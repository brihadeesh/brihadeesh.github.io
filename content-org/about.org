#+title: about me

I'm a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat supremacist that sometimes
cosplays as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [[https://voidlinux.org][Void
Linux]] installation with a manually compiled version of Emacs 29. I
also play the guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to
make my own music occasionally. I currently use [[https://ardour.org][Ardour 7.0]] for audio
production, which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the
[[https://sonic-pi.net][Sonic Pi]] as both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for
instruments I don't play myself.

This is a /static/ website and is intended to (eventually) be the home
for my blog, Emacs configuration and work updates. I hope to
eventually move to or host it there. This website uses a stylised
version of the theme from [[https://drewdevault.com][Drew Devault]]'s blog within the same [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]
framework. Everything you see here was written in [[https:orgmode.org][Org-mode]] on Emacs,
exported to markdown via [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]] for better compatibility - the
default [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]] parser doesn't appear to handle Org syntax
adequately. Read more about my blogging flow on my [[file:/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html][post]] about it.

The source for this website is on my [[https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/peregrinator.site][Sourcehut]].
