* What does /peregrinator/ mean?

/Peregrinator/ refers to one of two things, both of which I had in mind
while selecting the name. I had initially wanted to go with
Lammergeier (the German name for the [[https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/lammer1/cur/introduction][Bearded Vulture]]) but then it was
taken on most platforms. /Peregrinator/ is the subspecies name for the
Shaheen Falcon (/[[https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/perfal/cur/systematics#subsp][Falco peregrinus peregrinator]]/ — you might have to
scroll down here.) It is a beautiful falcon with a dark back and
upper-wings, a white throat, and vivid rufous underparts. It has a
typical dark "helmet" as seen in the photo. Juveniles have incomplete
hemlets and are a paler shade of rufous. Shaheen Bagh also happens to
be the name of the place chosen by the people protesting the unjust
implementation of the CAA and NRC in 2019. The word /peregrinator/
itself comes from Latin and is synonymous with [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peregrinator][traveller or
wanderer]]. The photo in the website logo is of a juvenile Shaheen,
displaying most of the characteristic features mentioned before, with
a Pond Heron kill.

* About me

I'm a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat person who sometimes cosplays
as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [[https://voidlinux.org][Void Linux]]
installation with the pure-gtk version of Emacs 30. I also play the
guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to make my own
music occasionally. I currently use [[https://ardour.org][Ardour 7.0]] for audio production,
which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the [[https://sonic-pi.net][Sonic Pi]] as
both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for instruments I
don't play myself. I also travel a lot for work and end up visiting a
lot of new places while I'm working. I will be starting working on
maintaining a log of that too sometime soon on this blog. Especially
the birding reports with links to eBird checklists since I'm in the
habit of maintaining them.

I have a cat at home and she's called Goose V. Goose the Fifth since
there have been four "Geese" before her. She's predominantly a stray
that just comes and hangs out at our place, but I hope to adopt her
soon. She loves to be indoors, especially in the winters since it gets
cold and she needs additional warmth. She doesn't mind jumping up next
to me on the chair or on the bed even. At night sometimes, she even
likes to sleep next to me. She's a talkative cat and often gets very
aggressive with the head bumps and the purring. She does get quite
loud too at times, especially when I pet her on her lower back, which
she loves, incidentally. Occasionally, she's so calm that she lets me
scratch her belly too, and this is rare apparently.

My last cat was also a stray and he was called Goose IV. He was so
incredibly affectionate that he would literally climb on top of me and
sleep in the winters, something Goose V has never done. He was a male
and so he would often end up in gruesome fights with a ginger cat,
whose territory overlapped with his, and ultimately he succumbed to
injuries after a particularly bad fight. He was also a small cat, much
like Goose V, and quite loud too.

* The blog

This is a /static/ website and is intended to be the home for my blog,
Emacs configuration and work updates. The blog is written and entirely
works out of my Emacs! Everything you see here was written in [[https:orgmode.org][Org-mode]]
on Emacs, exported to markdown via [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]] for better compatibility -
the default [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]] parser doesn't appear to handle Org syntax
adequately. Read more about my blogging flow on my [[file:/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html][post]] about it.

#+hugo: {{< figure src="/images/2023_blog.png" alt="screenshot of the blog from 2023" class="right rounded border-solid border-2 w-auto h-auto" caption="A screenshot of my blog from 2023">}}

I initially used a very basic blog-centric layout based off the [[https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/][Etch]]
theme, a simple dark theme with just a list of posts on the homepage.
In 2023, I switched to a theme-agnostic setup based on [[https://drewdevault.com][Drew Devault's
blog]] because it just looked so good in a ridiculously minimal sense
that appeals only to someone a little obsessively retro. This served
me well and I had published this as a Sourcehut page. It took me until
early this year to switch to this domain. I was using the [[https://github.com/jpanther/congo][Congo]] theme
until the beginning of March 2025 but I have since moved to a
personalised version of the [[https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/][Etch]] theme. The source for this website is
on my Sourcehut for the [[https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/peregrinator.site][blog]] and for my [[https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/emacs.peregrinator.site][Emacs]].
