I'm a 27 year old, neurodivergent cat supremacist that sometimes
cosplays as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [[https://voidlinux.org][Void
Linux]] installation with a manually compiled version of Emacs 29. I
also play the guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to
make my own music occasionally. I currently use [[https://ardour.org][Ardour 7.0]] for audio
production, which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the
[[https://sonic-pi.net][Sonic Pi]] as both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for
instruments I don't play myself.
