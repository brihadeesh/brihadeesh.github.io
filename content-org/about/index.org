I'm a 27 year old, non-binary, neurodivergent cat supremacist that
sometimes cosplays as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently
run a [[https://voidlinux.org][Void Linux]] installation with a manually compiled version of
Emacs 29. I also play the guitar, typically listen to metal and try to
make my own music occasionally. I use [[https://ardour.org][Ardour 7.0]] for audio production
and hope to get started with the [[https://sonic-pi.net][Sonic Pi]] as both a standalone synth
as well as a synth for instruments I don't physically play for what
I've been working on.

This is a work in progress and I'll soon have a more complete bio
here!
