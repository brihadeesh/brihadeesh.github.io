A collection of interesting and useful links I've found over my time
on the internet.

1. Blog post: [[https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html][Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my
   face]]. Drew DeVault writes about how AI/LLM crawlers unfairly get to
   overload small code repositories such as SourceHut and dump the
   costs of this onto people who want nothing to have to do with
   LLMS. This has been a long standing issue with the ethics of AI
   usage. The Wikimedia Foundation also reported an [[https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/][increase in their
   bandwidth costs]] of upto 50% due to AI crawlers.
2. Blog post: [[https://rinsemiddlebliss.com/posts/2024-10-04-90-day-performance-review-senior-cat/][90-day performance review for a senior cat]]. I came
   across this post from [[https://sfba.social/@dys_morphia][AK Krajewska]] when somebody boosted their
   toot. I found it quite nice to read.
