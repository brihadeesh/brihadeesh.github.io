#+title: privacy

Being the weird privacy nerd that I am, I've taken steps to ensure
that there is very little date about myself on this site that can be
really abused. I have also designed the website in such a way that
people visiting don't have to leave behind any kind of data.

* Analytics

This website doesn't have any kind of analytics running in the
background. I don't care for keeping track of how many people read my
blog or any of that.

* Cookies

I don't shove cookies down anyone's throat. You're free to use any
tools to check this. For example [[https://www.cookiemetrix.com/][Cookie Metrix]] reports that there are
none.
