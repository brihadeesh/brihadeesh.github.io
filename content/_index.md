I've called this my _sourcehut_ site because I hope to eventually move
to or host it there. This website uses [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for the styling,
and everything you see here was written in [org-mode](https:orgmode.org), exported to
markdown using [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) for better compatibility with Hugo - the
default [go-org](https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org) parser doesn't appear to support org-mode syntax in its
entirety.
