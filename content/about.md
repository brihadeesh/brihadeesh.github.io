## What does _peregrinator_ mean? {#what-does-peregrinator-mean}

_Peregrinator_ refers to one of two things, both of which I had in mind
while selecting the name. I had initially wanted to go with
Lammergeier (the German name for the [Bearded Vulture](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/lammer1/cur/introduction)) but then it was
taken on most platforms. _Peregrinator_ is the subspecies name for the
Shaheen Falcon (_[Falco peregrinus peregrinator](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/perfal/cur/systematics#subsp)_ — you might have to
scroll down here.) It is a beautiful falcon with a dark back and
upper-wings, a white throat, and vivid rufous underparts. It has a
typical dark "helmet" as seen in the photo. Juveniles have incomplete
hemlets and are a paler shade of rufous. Shaheen Bagh also happens to
be the name of the place chosen by the people protesting the unjust
implementation of the CAA and NRC in 2019. The word _peregrinator_
itself comes from Latin and is synonymous with [traveller or wanderer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peregrinator).

## About me {#about-me}

{{< figure src="/images/about.jpg" alt="Author wearing a red t-shirt with their hair down" class="left rounded border-solid border-2 w-40 h-auto" >}}

I'm a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat person who sometimes cosplays
as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org)
installation with the pure-gtk version of Emacs 30. I also play the
guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to make my own
music occasionally. I currently use [Ardour 7.0](https://ardour.org) for audio production,
which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) as
both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for instruments I
don't play myself. I also travel a lot for work and end up visiting a
lot of new places while I'm working. I will be starting working on
maintaining a log of that too sometime soon on this blog. Especially
the birding reports with links to eBird checklists since I'm in the
habit of maintaining them.

I have a cat at home and she's called Goose V. Goose the Fifth since
there have been four "Geese" before her. She's predominantly a stray
that just comes and hangs out at our place, but I hope to adopt her
soon. She loves to be indoors, especially in the winters since it gets
cold and she needs additional warmth. She doesn't mind jumping up next
to me on the chair or on the bed even. At night sometimes, she even
likes to sleep next to me. She's a talkative cat and often gets very
aggressive with the head bumps and the purring. She does get quite
loud too at times, especially when I pet her on her lower back, which
she loves, incidentally. Occasionally, shes so calm that she lets me
scratch her belly too, and this is rare apparently.

## The blog {#the-blog}

This is a _static_ website and is intended to be the home for my blog,
Emacs configuration and work updates. The blog is written and entirely
works out of my Emacs! Everything you see here was written in [Org-mode](https:orgmode.org)
on Emacs, exported to markdown via [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) for better compatibility -
the default [go-org](https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org) parser doesn't appear to handle Org syntax
adequately. Read more about my blogging flow on my [post](/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html) about it.

I initially used a very basic blog-centric layout based off the [Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/)
theme, a simple dark theme with just a list of posts on the homepage.
In 2023, I switched to a theme-agnostic setup based on [Drew Devault's
blog](https://drewdevault.com) because it just looked so good in a ridiculously minimal sense
that appeals only to someone a little obsessively retro. This served
me well and I had published this as a Sourcehut page. It took me until
early this year to switch to this domain. and I have since moved to a
personalised version of the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme. The source for this website
is on my [Github](https://github.com/brihadeesh/peregrinator.site) and [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/emacs.peregrinator.site).
