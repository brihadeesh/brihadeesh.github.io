## What does _peregrinator_ mean? {#what-does-peregrinator-mean}

_Peregrinator_ refers to one of two things, both of which I had in mind
while selecting the name. I had initially wanted to go with
Lammergeier (the German name for the [Bearded Vulture](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/lammer1/cur/introduction)) but then it was
taken on most platforms. _Peregrinator_ is the subspecies name for the
Shaheen Falcon (_[Falco peregrinus peregrinator](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/perfal/cur/systematics#subsp)_ — you might have to
scroll down here.) It is a beautiful falcon with a dark back and
upper-wings, a white throat, and vivid rufous underparts. It has a
typical dark "helmet" as seen in the photo. Juveniles have incomplete
hemlets and are a paler shade of rufous. Shaheen Bagh also happens to
be the name of the place chosen by the people protesting the unjust
implementation of the CAA and NRC in 2019. The word _peregrinator_
itself comes from Latin and is synonymous with [traveller or wanderer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peregrinator).

## About me {#about-me}

{{< figure src="/img/about.png" alt="Author wearing a red t-shirt with their hair down" class="left rounded border-solid border-2 w-40 h-auto" >}}

I'm a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat supremacist that sometimes
cosplays as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [Void
Linux](https://voidlinux.org) installation with a manually compiled version of Emacs 29. I
also play the guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to
make my own music occasionally. I currently use [Ardour 7.0](https://ardour.org) for audio
production, which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the
[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) as both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for
instruments I don't play myself.

This is a _static_ website and is intended to (eventually) be the home
for my blog, Emacs configuration and work updates. I hope to
eventually move to or host it there. This website uses a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
framework and uses a personalised version of the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo)
theme. Everything you see here was written in [Org-mode](https:orgmode.org) on Emacs,
exported to markdown via [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) for better compatibility - the
default [go-org](https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org) parser doesn't appear to handle Org syntax
adequately. Read more about my blogging flow on my [post](/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html) about it.

I can be contacted at [`contact [at] peregrinator.site`](mailto:contact@peregrinator.site) or through
Bluesky [`[at] peregrinator.site`](https://bsky.app/profile/peregrinator.site). Support me at [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/peregrinator). The
