I was starkly aware of how my last post, [Notes from a withdrawal
episode](/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode.html), felt somewhat incomplete but couldn't really figure out what
it was that was "missing" from it. Someone on twitter had asked
whether being on the medication was of any help and I responded to
this saying it was too large a topic to cover in tweets and that it
wasn't something I could address on twitter — it would involve really
gathering my thoughts and writing a thread there while doing so
perhaps felt daunting at that point. It still took me a while to
figure out what was missing from my last post was something of a
description of what being on Methylphenidate was like and so I decided
to write this post about it as something of a _prequel_ to my last
post. Like I'd mentioned to the person that had asked that it wasn't
as straightforward an answer as _good_ or _bad_.

My psychiatrist had initially started me off on a course of
Atomoxetine when I got the diagnosis and it felt like it helped
initially, because of the novelty of it, I imagine. Regardless, it
took me a while to understand that it wasn't working for me, perhaps
owing to the other drug I was on — Sertraline, a powerful SSRI
commonly known by its generic name Zoloft — which often left me
feeling groggy and exhausted all the time. It was when my doctor
started me off on Methylphenidate that I started seeing consistent
changes.

Now this is a powerful stimulant and tricky to procure considering it
is an amphetamine. The relationship between ADHD and powerful
stimulants is interesting. People with ADHD typically have lower
levels of dopamine and vastly limited means to access it.[^fn:1] Dopamine is the "reward" hormone and is automatically
released by the brain when one does activities they enjoy but this
release pathway isn't as reliable or functional for someone with
ADHD.[^fn:2] In order to artificially regulate dopamine
levels, stimulants such as amphetamines are used to hack the automatic
dopamine-high the drug provides as remedy for dysfunctional dopamine
signalling. My doctor got me started on Methylphenidate roughly 8
months back. Lower doses at first, slowly leading up to a steady 40 mg
(50 mg more recently).

Initially, it felt a little exhilarating — possibly owing to the
novelty — but I was fairly certain of a difference in how motivated I
felt. Creative bursts, or hyperfocus sessions for that matter, were
more frequent when I'm unmedicated (and not in withdrawal) but they're
also notoriously unreliable. They're too random and unpredictable in
all senses of the word and any attempts at doing things consistency
ultimately fail because the kind of motivation is ultimately moody and
manic. Sometimes, a kind of restlessness overpowers my ability to do
anything meaningful and I'm left annoyed and irritable with my brain
on overdrive. The medication, in a sense, helps gather these
unmanageable peaks and troughs and even them out into a more steady
sort of motivation. Oddly enough, I still find that I'm more
_involved_ and capable of things that need more creative solutions in
some of my unmedicated hyperfocus sessions.

I'm typically well aware of what tasks I'm yet to complete and despite
that I'm almost never able to get myself to do those things
unmedicated. I can maybe get one, relatively simple task done in the
same short-lived bursts of clarity described earlier but the moment
I'm done with it, an irritability and often a kind of anxiety sets in,
possibly stemming from fatigue. For perhaps the first 2-3 months on
the medication, I was able to do some of the larger tasks with ease
although I still needed breaks.

I could also notice, over the course of the entire period of time I
was on the medication, how I was significantly less preoccupied with
lowered self-esteem and getting carried away into dramatic depressive
states triggered by criticism or rejection (rejection sensitive
dysphoria)[^fn:3] — I even found that I was more
straightforward with dealing with conversations of the sort that
bothered me, especially those involving having my experiences
invalidated.

I need to be constantly stimulated externally — a good coffee in the
morning that gets me going and more importantly keeps me alert. I'm
more dependent on this while I'm off the medication. Thinking back on
it, a large part of what I look for here is some degree of comfort —
as little sources of annoyance and a relatively peaceful space to do
things — to be able to work with any amount of consistency. While on
medication, these stop being needs.

The medication, however, has a few side effects that I've observed —
there are a lot more that one should look out for, some of these often
quite serious too.[^fn:4] The most prominent of these was
insomnia. I've had issues with sleep all along but this worsened for
the initial few months on the medication. The only solution that
showed promise in dealing with this was to plan and keep to a regular
routine. Melatonin could potentially help fall asleep but it made me
nauseous on the next day for several hours after waking. This, coupled with
intense withdrawal symptoms are perhaps the biggest issues I faced.

This doesn't cover everything, nor was it intended to. There are a few
things I have consciously omitted for the sake of my own
sanity. Regardless, I hope to make this and the other post into a
series I keep adding to periodically.
