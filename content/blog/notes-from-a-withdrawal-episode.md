I was reading Adrianna's (or "[Pop22](https://popagandhi.com/)"'s) last blog post '[I Now Have an
Attention Span](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2023-02-attention-span/)' after they asked for new blog feeds they could follow
on the fediverse and I realised I wasn't following their blog anywhere
— I've since added it everywhere, including in my openring
configuration — and got thinking about a thing or two about my own
progress with ADHD over the last four-odd years since my diagnosis. I
do see something of an arc in my capacity for regular work and keeping
at doing different kinds of work, similar to what they describe, but
I'm not nearly there yet.

I find that there are some things I can stay focused on and work
through. Sadly these have minimal overlap with what I've chosen for my
career. I like working with computers — fooling around with R, trying
to learn e-lisp an figure out Emacs, and well, setting up this blog
too — and it's startling to see how little there is in terms of job
opportunities that involve any of these within ecology or wildlife
science. I realise I'm digressing but the point I'm trying to make
here is that I find that my attention span having improved applies
only to a very limited kind of thing.

It's been roughly two weeks since I ran out of my medication
(Methylphenidate — commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta) and I've
been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. This is the longest I've
been off this since I got started some six months back. I've had
disturbed sleep (I'm writing this at midnight!), heightened anxiety
that often manifests as anxiety attacks, and in general rapid mood
changes and more but I've also seen some things that were surprising.

The same kinds of work I thought I could do better has become a whole
lot easier to do now, while I'm in this withdrawal state, for the most
part. I also find my thoughts to be clearer and that I no longer miss
out on important cues of various kinds. This is quite irregular but is
in no way sustainable in the long term for myriad reasons.
