I've been deploying this blog using Sourcehut builds from my Sourcehut
repo for some time now but I've started to have doubts about whether I
want to stick to this given the [limitations](https://srht.site/limitations) on Sourcehut pages. I've
not had to thing about this a lot until recently since I also switched
up my Hugo theme to [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), which has a few additional features. These
in turn inspired me to incorporate comments from Bluesky too but this
doesn't work on the [site](https://peregrinator.site) deployed from my [Sourcehut repo](https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/peregrinator.site).
