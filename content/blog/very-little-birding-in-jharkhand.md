I recently had the chance to visit and stay at a friend's place in a
small mining district of Jharkhand called Koderma. It is a small town
just across the border from Bihar and is best known for its mineral
rich hills where a good deal of legal and illegal mining occurs. The
friend whose place I was staying at had a few basalt mines in the area
and it was in and around those locations that I got to do some
birding. I didn't have access to a vehicle and asking the friend to
arrange for a vehicle for me seemed too tedious a task considering how
preoccupied he was throughout my visit with work and the
businesses. There was also an apparent shortage of vehicles and the
local public transportation was a bit of a black box for me. It seemed
unlikely that most buses would go to places I was keen on
visiting.

The town itself neighbours several, seemingly unexplored, forested
hills. Some of these had communities living within, and I believe
visiting some of their settlements — or even anywhere close to them —
without adequate preparation and correspondence with necessary people
could have been a potentially dangerous endeavour, for reasons unknown
to me.
