The last couple of weeks have been eventful and has seen a ton of new
releases out of which I've listened to probably just an album or
two. There was a [toilet themed slam band](https://putriddefecation.bandcamp.com/album/tales-from-the-toilet) that put out something with
some really sick riffs. There was the album from Serein that used a
painting by Thomas Cole called "The Voyage of Life: Old Age" from 1942
as their cover art. Most people that checked it out, complained that
it had clean vocals, something not everyone appreciates in death
metal. This painting, however, was first used by Candlemass on their
phenomenal 1987 album [Nightfall](https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/nightfall) and that led to some hilarious
reactions from people on Bluesky.

Nergal from Behemoth apparently decided to become the "oldest
teenager" and went on a rant about Christianity and posted something
pretty lame on his Instagram.


## What even is skramz? {#what-even-is-skramz}

What started as me just checking out something [Adzes](https://bsky.app/profile/adzes.bsky.social) posted on Bluesky
went on to become a full fledged phase for me. It was Orphan Donor's
[Old Patterns](/blog/2025/01/what-even-is-skramz/#orphan-donor-old-patterns) and it went from there to checking out a whole bunch of
what is called screamo or skramz. Now, I"m not entirely sure whether
the two are interchangeable and I haven't really checked but they're
all closely linked to hardcore and other \*-core genres, grindcore and
crust. They often sound similar to each other but perhaps some
defining characteristics of the genre include loud riffs, short songs
and albums (not typically over 20-30 minutes long) and vocals that are
typically high fry screams. The vocals are delivered somewhat rapidly
with some slurred words so you really have to pay attention to catch
their lyrics. What I've been listening to has been a lot of this, some
death metal and some hardcore and I've talked about some of the
highlights.
