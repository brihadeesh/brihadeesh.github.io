The last week has been eventful and has seen a ton of new releases out
of which I've listened to probably just an album or two. There was a
[toilet themed slam band](https://putriddefecation.bandcamp.com/album/tales-from-the-toilet) that put out something with some really sick
riffs. There was the album from Serein that used a painting by Thomas
Cole called "The Voyage of Life: Old Age" from 1942 as their cover
art. Most people that checked it out, complained that it had clean
vocals, something not everyone appreciates in death metal.

This painting, however, was first used by Candlemass on their
phenomenal 1987 album [Nightfall](https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/nightfall) and that led to some hilarious
reactions from people on Bluesky.
