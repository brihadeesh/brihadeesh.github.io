I've only just started learning about things like the blogroll after
nearly 10 years of having a blog and I love reading so here's a bunch
of really cool people whose blogs you should also read.

1.  [Drew Devault's blog](https://drewdevault.com/): Drew founded Sourcehut, the Sway window
    manager, a lot more software and now maintains all of them. He
    writes about a variety of topics I find that his takes on political
    issues really resonate with mine. He truly embraces the open source
    philosophy in all of the ways I wish I could.
2.  [Propagandhi](https://popagandhi.com/): [Adrianna Tan](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte) is someone I met and got to know on
    Mastodon and she writes a lot about food and what it's like to be
    neurodivergent.
3.  [Amanda's Writing Corner](https://amandaswritingblog9.wordpress.com/): [Amanda](https:bsky.app/profile/amandak6647.bsky.social) is a musician and plays black/death
    metal. She writes fiction and set up this blog to put it out
    there. We've been friends for a while from Twitter (now Bluesky).
4.  [Ambika Kamath](https://ambikamath.com/): [Ambika](https://bsky.app/profile/ammbikamath.bsky.social) is an ecologist and has worked on lizards for
    her PhD. She writes about ecology and has currently co-authored a
    book called Feminism in the Wild.
5.  [Noob Heavy](https://noobheavy.com/): [Kep](https:bsky.app/profile/theoriginalkep.bsky.social), [Westin](https:bsky.app/profile/westinplaying.bsky.social), Ellis and Kirk run this wonderful blog on
    new and upcoming releases in the metal world. If you're also into
    metal, this is a must follow.
6.  [Sleeping Village Reviews](https://www.sleepingvillagereviews.com/): I've been friends with... erm... well I
    don't know his name, but well we've been friend for quite some time
    now from Twitter to now Bluesky. We discuss a lot of metal and he
    writes reviews for, well, all kinds of metal. You know the drill.
7.  [The Toronto Public Libra](https://torontopubliclibra.com/): Dana "Rusty" Rosamund Teagle is a friend
    from Bluesky and she has "spent her entire life being gay on a
    computer." Her blog is linked on her website.[^fn:1]
8.  [Seema Mundoli](https://medium.com/@seemamundoli): Seema writes about her three quirky cats, CI Mykah,
    Fuzzu and Noori. They're a LOT of fun.
9.  [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/): [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) is a tech guy and he maintains the [fosstodon.org](https:fosstodon.org)
    instance on Mastodon. He writes about a variety of stuff but mostly
    just life, and watches.
10. [False Knees](https://falseknees.com/): the hilarious bird comic!
11. [View from Elephant Hills](https://shankarraman.in/): [TR Shankar Raman](https://biodiversity.social/@mizoraman) has been an old family
    friend and he used to go birding with my father. He has been
    writing this blog for quite some time now and usually talks about
    ecological issues and bird-watching.
12. [Neil's blog](https://neilzone.co.uk/index.xml): [Neil Brown](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil) writes about tech and is very vocal about
    stuff that has to do with the internet. He's also very active on
    the Fediverse. His blog was one of the key contributors to my
    switching back to the Etch theme.
13. [EnbySpacePerson](https://write.as/enbyspaceperson/): [Eve](https://toot.cat/@EveHasWords) writes about various topics and I'm typically
    most interested in their posts on using the fediverse. They also
    write [adult fiction](https://chantingluretales.writeas.com/).
14. [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com): This is a collection of articles on how people use R
    and other allied data science tools written by various
    contributors. This is an invaluable resource if you're looking to
    learn advanced R.

[^fn:1]: Dana uses a
    Substack and I feel like I shouldn't be providing the blogging
    service any traffic from my end since "its chief executive defended
    hosting and handling payments for “Nazis” on its platform, citing
    anti-censorship reasons." See [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/03/substack-user-revolt-anti-censorship-stance-neo-nazis) from The Guardian. Hence
    I've not provided a direct link to her Substack.
