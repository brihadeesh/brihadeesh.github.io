A collection of interesting and useful links I've found over my time
on the internet.

1.  Blog post: [Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my
    face](https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html). Drew DeVault writes about how AI/LLM crawlers unfairly get to
    overload small code repositories such as SourceHut and dump the
    costs of this onto people who want nothing to have to do with
    LLMS. This has been a long standing issue with the ethics of AI
    usage. The Wikimedia Foundation also reported an [increase in their
    bandwidth costs](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/) of upto 50% due to AI crawlers.
2.  Blog post: [90-day performance review for a senior cat](https://rinsemiddlebliss.com/posts/2024-10-04-90-day-performance-review-senior-cat/). I came
    across this post from [AK Krajewska](https://sfba.social/@dys_morphia) when somebody boosted their
    toot. I found it quite nice to read.
