I dread publishing lists of this kind especially because I have a
tendency to forget artists and albums, often even those that I listen
to regularly. I also remember bands by sound and almost inevitably
refuse to keep track of when albums I like were released. This was a
good year for music in many ways. I -

-   got back into Death metal (see my [other article](/2022/12/finding-the-right-groove-with-death-metal/) on Death metal)
-   explored my ass off and ventured into a good number of new kinds of metal
-   discovered several new artists
-   stayed off most modern "metalcore" and the various sub-genres of it.


## KEN mode - Null {#ken-mode-null}

**TODO** check shortcode implementaiton for ox-hugo
**TODO** add shortcode

Exasperated with everything good in life going to dogs? _Throw Your
Phone in the River_! It's a typical KEN mode release - noisy, ambient
with an abundance of harsh industrial sound, delivered with bleak,
sludgy instrumentation. This time they're a four piece with Kathryn
Kerr joining bringing in the saxophone which expectedly sounds great
with this brand of metal. This release also marks a stylistic shift
from their typically outright angry sound and now has a tinge of
despair in the way the vocals are delivered - a post-metal influence
perhaps?

## [EP] Primitive Man - Insurmountable {#ep-primitive-man-insurmountable}

**TODO** check phrasing
**TODO** add shortcode
**TODO** add shortcode for Vermin Womb (small one)

From practitioners of the most brutal Death/Sludge - the amalgam of
Sludge and Death metal - the latest offering from Primitive Man
bludgeons the anxieties and dread the pandemic made commonplace into
a slow-burning, dirty, dark and angry record. Ethan McCarthy's other
project - Vermin Womb which has a similar sound but with a great
deal of Death/Grind influence - also saw a new release that I'd also
recommend.
