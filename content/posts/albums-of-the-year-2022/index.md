I dread publishing lists of this kind especially because I have a
tendency to forget artists and albums, often even those that I listen
to regularly. I also remember bands by sound and almost inevitably
refuse to keep track of when albums I like were released. This was a
good year for music in many ways. I -

-   got back into Death metal (see my [other article](/2022/12/finding-the-right-groove-with-death-metal/) on Death metal)
-   explored my ass off and ventured into a good number of new kinds of metal
-   discovered several new artists
-   stayed off most modern "metalcore" and the various sub-genres of it.


## KEN mode - Null {#ken-mode-null}

Exasperated with everything good in life going to dogs? _Throw Your
Phone in the River_! It's noisy, ambient with an abundance of harsh
industrial sounds blended into the background, delivered with bleak,
sludgy instrumentation. This time they're a four piece, with the
addition of Kathryn Kerr bringing in the saxophone and it expectedly
sounds great with this brand of metal. This release also marks a
stylistic shift from their typically outright angry sound to this
tinge of despair in the way the vocals are delivered.

## Primitive Man - Insurmountable {#primitive-man-insurmountable}

From practitioners of the most brutal form of Death/Sludge arguably
pioneered by them, the latest offering from Primitive Man bludgeons
the anxieties and dread that came with the pandemic into a
slow-burning, gloomy and angry 4 track record. Their sound appears to
have been perfected over the years into the combination of oppressive
mammoth-like riffs, a loud menacing bass, copious amounts of guitar
feedback and noise samples embedded into the background, and drums
with the hint of a twang on the snare leaving the listener in an
atmosphere dripping with tension and apprehension. McCarthy's vocals
are as wild as ever - there's undertones of the sludge scream, the
black metal snarl, alloyed with the Death-growl into guttural lows and
highs. This album also includes a cover of "Quiet" by the Smashing
Pumpkins.

Ethan McCarthy's other project - Vermin Womb - also saw a new release
that I'd also recommend. It's similar sounding in the instrumentation
and overall feel but has songs played in a more blackened and Grindcore
style.

## Kathryn Mohr - Holly {#kathryn-mohr-holly}

Liminal perhaps describes the kind of music Kathryn Mohr makes
accurately and in a single word but it's got a lot more to it. I find
that listening to this album when I need to unwind makes the process a
lot easier and a great deal more enjoyable, but I'm inevitably left
craving more. _Holly_ has droney chords strummed on a Jazzmaster (?),
fuzzy and exclusively on neck pickups - and I feel like I shouldn't
have to describe this any further but I'll just add that it takes the
edge off the typical bright tone. This perfectly compliments haunting,
layered vocals that sometimes sound off-key. The vocals don't appear
to be too central to her sound and songs are often instrumental,
overlaid with pretty synth riffs and crucially set in a brown-noise
base. Also worth noting is the way tracks are arranged in the style of
a cassette release - both sides have short instrumental introductory
pieces and is available as a cassette on her Bandcamp!
