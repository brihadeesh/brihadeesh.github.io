I've been into a _lot_ of metal for the last 10-odd years of my
life. It's played the part of coping mechanism for a lot of what I
went through as a teenager and has had a way of making some of the
most mundane or depressive phases bearable, it's sometimes even
uplifting. Of course, nothing's ever a substitute for getting one's
hands dirty with therapy, but it's somehow stayed with me the longest
amongst all the music I've ever been into. However, the process of
_looking_ for an album or artist to listen to is one of the most surreal
experiences I've had the chance to revisit nearly every day. There's
inevitably a long list to choose from, and with me often forgetting
names of bands or albums, _precisely_ when I decide to listen to them,
it gets even more interesting to dredge though my library on Spotify
and immensely gratifying to listen to them after I've found them.


## one grows _into_ the metal {#one-grows-into-the-metal}

But this isn't about just _all_ metal. Death metal is something I've
been fascinated by since I exited my _classic-metal_- and _nu-metal_-
phases. It wasn't that bands like Metallica, Judas Priest, or System
of a Down lost their charm for me, but with this ever increasing need
for stimulation (I didn't know it then), I found that I was looking
for more intense. I liked the idea of it, but I didn't particularly
like harsh vocals. It was around 2011 and since back then I couldn't
browse youtube, I had to read up about bands that seemed interesting
on Wikipedia of all places. It was from there that I forayed into the
first _extreme_-metal ever. It was some The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch
Enemy (which a friend had introduced me to), and Enslaved which I
_liked_ and some Deicide, Decapitated which I had mixed feelings about
and _Deathcrush_ by Mayhem which I really wanted to like but have grown
to hate over the years. Soilwork, Meshuggah and a few others came by
and those really stuck. It took me a while to really get into the
"classics" because soon after this, I somehow just stopped listening
to music regularly a while and lapsed into some half-decent prog-metal
and a lot of the worst music I've ever listened to (you know,
metalcore/deathcore/junk).

Some of the albums and artists I'd heard haunted me though. It was
like this nearly inaudible voice at the back of my head that kept
telling me to get back to Death metal and that I would be able to find
something that I really liked. Till date, this "voice" has only gotten
louder. I didn't dislike Death metal. I wasn't forcing myself through
something unpleasant. I wanted to listen to it because I just knew it
was what I really liked. Anyway I got back to it about a year ago when
I met JP on twitter and we started exchanging recommendations and
subsequently interactions with other musicians too!

But most other "normal" people I've talked to about this fascination
only tell me that it's sounded forced and self-inflicted torture and
that's always left me reluctant to talk about it. Thinking about it
today, while trying to find something "appropriate" for the moment,
I'm reminded of that feeling of oppressive discomfort I'd experience
when I wasn't able to "explain" my relationship with this kind of
music to somebody, especially when I was starkly aware of the fact
that they weren't even into metal. Worse, when they had opinions like
"all metalheads are shit people", "metal is attention seeking" and
sundry variations of "the music I listen to is better than
yours". "Metal is attention seeking" takes the cake though,
considering it's sometimes true, unironically. There is a lot of metal
that's about topics otherwise shunned, but I digress.


## each moment is a different metal {#each-moment-is-a-different-metal}

It's now apparent that it wasn't that which bothered me as much and
now I see two cryptic reasons for why I felt uncomfortable around
this.

1.  My music tastes are supremely _personal_ and that I'm unabashedly
    selfish about it. I can talk about it, discussing the physical
    experiences and associations I have with the sound on platforms
    like twitter or Mastodon, but never in-person, except with a short
    list of people I know appreciate discussions about this, at varying
    depths.
2.  The music I listen to at any given point of time is solely
    dependant on how or what I'm feeling at that point of time and that
    it can change without warning. Since I don't only listen to Death
    metal, I could sound entirely disinterested in it occasionally.

But this doesn't end here. Even within Death metal, I often have to
spend some time to identify what band or album to listen to because I
form deep-rooted associations with the sound of each album or
band. Only some bands sound right for me. Before I started writing
this article, I went though some 20-odd artists looking for one artist
that was known to make longer and more intricate Death metal songs
despite being one of the first wave. I haven't found it yet (and
anyone that reads this, if you know what I'm talking about, do hit me
up on Mastodon). But then I settled into _Descend into Depravity_ by
Morbid Angel and _Pierced from Within_ by Suffocation and they've worked
great!

It's when I don't find the right Death metal, and I'm incessantly
shuffling though Spotify's "Fans also like" or the abomination this is
their landing screen, on my phone, that I feel like that discomfort
returns. This must be a neurodivergent thing because no-one else I've
met has ever shared anything even remotely similar.


## interpreting death metal {#interpreting-death-metal}

It's, of course, obvious that people look to music to vastly different
ends. Labelling any kind of extreme metal as "noise" or as any other
synonym of it seems superficial. When I started off with bands like
Metallica, Judas Priest and others, it felt _necessary_ for the songs I
listened to to be energetic but also not with outright 190 bpm riffs
and harsh vocals. They had to sound "melodic", in the conventional
sense that Indian music often adheres to. I also found that I often
couldn't listen to full albums even if I wanted to. There was just a
handful of songs on my repeat listens that I'd play and perhaps go
back to softer stuff with. Even though I wouldn't go to the extent to
call bands like Led Zeppelin "real" metal today but back then it was
quite a good distance away from what most of my friends listened
to. And that apparent "gap" in trying to get others (including my
parents) to understand why I listened to this left me feeling a little
uneasy about trying to think about why I liked listening to it and
this followed into a lot of the music I came across later. I still
have trouble putting those thoughts and emotions to words. Instead of
jumping right into that side of things, I think perhaps I'll get down
to something MR had mentioned in response to an earlier revision of
this article: what is Death metal?

Imagine two guitarists on the front-facing corners of a stage with a
drummer somewhere in the middle and a bassist slightly off-centre
stage. There doesn't even need to be long hair or inverted crosses or
satanic symbols anywhere. The backdrop could be unintelligible text
