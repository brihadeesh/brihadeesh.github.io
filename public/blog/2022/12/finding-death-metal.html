  <article>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been into a <em>lot</em> of metal for the last 10-odd years of my life and
has had a way of making some of the most mundane or depressive phases
bearable, it&rsquo;s sometimes even uplifting. But that&rsquo;s perhaps a shallow
take on metal given what it means for me. The process of <em>looking</em> for
an album or artist to listen to is one of the most surreal experiences
I&rsquo;ve had the chance to revisit nearly every day. There&rsquo;s my
(inevitably) long list of favourites to pick from, and with me often
forgetting names of bands or albums, <em>precisely</em> when I decide to listen
to them, it gets even more interesting to dredge though my library on
Spotify and immensely gratifying to listen to them after I&rsquo;ve found
them.</p>
<p>But this article isn&rsquo;t about just <em>all</em> metal. Death metal is something
that&rsquo;s fascinated me since I exited my <em>classic</em>- and <em>nu</em>-metal-
phases. It wasn&rsquo;t that bands like Metallica, Judas Priest, or System
of a Down, which I was really big into until then, had lost their
charm for me, but with this ever increasing need for titillation (I
didn&rsquo;t know it to be &ldquo;stimulation&rdquo; in the ADHD sense then), I found
that I was looking for more intense and fuller sounding music. I liked
the concept and premise of it from what I&rsquo;d read (on Wikipedia, no
less), although I didn&rsquo;t particularly like harsh vocals. This is from
around 2011 and since back then I couldn&rsquo;t just browse youtube, I had
to read about bands, find those that <em>sounded</em> interesting, and then get
their music from somewhere. It was then that I forayed into my first
<em>extreme</em>-metal music ever. The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy (which a
friend had introduced me to earlier), and Enslaved which <em>really</em> agreed
with me, and some Deicide, Decapitated which I had mixed
feelings. <em>Deathcrush</em> by Mayhem was another which I&rsquo;d desperately
wanted to like but have expectedly grown to hate over the
years. Soilwork, Meshuggah and a few others came by and those
stuck.</p>
<p>It took me a while to really get into the &ldquo;classics&rdquo; of Death metal
because soon after this, I somehow just stopped looking for new music
to listen to regularly a while and lapsed into a lazy selection of
popular prog-metal and a lot of the worst music I&rsquo;ve ever listened to
(you know, metalcore/deathcore which I think of as junk now). Whatever
little Death metal I&rsquo;d heard haunted me though. It was like this
faint, nearly inaudible voice at the back of my head that kept telling
me to get back to Death metal and that I would be able to find
something that I really liked. Till date, the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; has only ever
gotten louder.</p>
<p>Most &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people I&rsquo;ve talked to about this fascination only tell
me that it&rsquo;s sounded forced and describe it as if it were
self-inflicted torture or something that I&rsquo;ve only gotten accustomed
to. That&rsquo;s always left me reluctant to talk about it or even
contemplate what was happening then. Thinking about it today, while
trying to find something &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to listen to for the moment,
I&rsquo;m reminded of that feeling of oppressive discomfort I&rsquo;d experience
when I wasn&rsquo;t able to &ldquo;explain&rdquo; my relationship with this kind of
music to somebody, especially when I was starkly aware of the fact
that they weren&rsquo;t even into metal. Worse, when they had opinions like
&ldquo;all metalheads are shit people&rdquo; and sundry variations of &ldquo;the music I
listen to is better than yours&rdquo;. &ldquo;Metal is attention seeking&rdquo; takes
the cake though, considering it&rsquo;s sometimes true, unironically. And
there&rsquo;s some truth to &ldquo;all metalheads are shit people&rdquo; as I&rsquo;ve come to
realise. I didn&rsquo;t dislike Death metal, nor was I forcing myself
through something unpleasant. I <em>wanted</em> to listen to it because I
instinctively knew it was what I really liked. Anyway I got back to it
about a year ago when I met JP on twitter and we started loosely
exchanging recommendations and subsequently interactions with other
musicians too!</p>
<h2 id="the-death-metal-aesthetic">the Death metal aesthetic</h2>
<p>But to try and understand what it was that I went through that made
this particular brand of metal hold so powerful an influence over me,
I think I must try and explore what goes on in my thoughts when I
listen to it. It&rsquo;s, of course, obvious that people look to music to
vastly different ends. This is also based on something MR had
referenced in a response to an earlier draft. I later realised that
this was part of what I&rsquo;d intended to write about, but had somehow
overlooked it before prematurely publishing this!</p>
<p>Labelling any kind of extreme metal as &ldquo;noise&rdquo; or as any other synonym
of it is superficial and meaningless because metal has am, often,
twisted <em>aesthetic</em>. Keep in mind that &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; here is <strong>not</strong> used in
the (often erroneous and colloquial) sense of the word implying <em>beauty</em>
but more about what it evokes in the mind in terms of what one
associates with it, much like TM Krishna&rsquo;s description of it&rsquo;s meaning
in <em>A Southern Music</em> <strong><em>CHECK THIS REFERENCE and DEFINITION</em></strong>.</p>
<p>When I started off with bands like Metallica, Judas Priest and others,
it felt <em>necessary</em> for the songs I listened to to be exciting and
uplifting but also not with outright toasty 190 bpm riffs and harsh
vocals. They had to sound &ldquo;melodic&rdquo;, in the conventional sense that
Indian music often adheres to, where there&rsquo;s clean vocals singing a
tune. I also found that I often couldn&rsquo;t listen to full albums through
even if I wanted to. There were a handful of songs that I&rsquo;d play over
and over, and perhaps some other softer music to go back to. I
wouldn&rsquo;t label bands like Led Zeppelin &ldquo;real&rdquo; metal but back even
these were quite a good distance away from what most of my friends
listened to. It makes sense that some of the first extreme metal bands
I&rsquo;d liked had some parts that were &ldquo;conventionally&rdquo; pleasant.</p>
<p>Why scream and rend one&rsquo;s throat <strong><em>FIND THAT ARCHAIC WORD I WAS LOOKING
FOR</em></strong> just to make it sound uglier? Why write riffs that are so
unpleasant to the ear and make no &ldquo;sense&rdquo; harmonically? Let me start
by saying those constraints were limiting from the start and there is
an aesthetic to these too.</p>
<h3 id="1-dot-groove">1. Groove</h3>
<p>The first aesthetic that&rsquo;s the most commonly relatable: <em>groove</em>. Do you
find your body slowly moving to the rhythm of a riff? Guitars by
themselves needn&rsquo;t have this. Put a loud, sometimes distorted bass
playing the same riff on a lower octave. Add a double kick drumkit,
with not just the clean filtered drums you hear elsewhere. The pedal
trigger sounds are included in a truly acoustic recording and you&rsquo;ll
slowly start finding yourself moved by the rapid double bass beat and
perhaps even tilting your head forward ever so slightly each time the
snare is hit. This isn&rsquo;t as apparent all the time considering a lot of
Death metal isn&rsquo;t like conventional songs with a repetitive
verse-chorus pattern and a lot of riffs tend to be rhythmically
complex.</p>
<h3 id="2-dot-wholeness-of-sound">2. Wholeness of sound</h3>
<p>For someone that needs a <em>lot</em> of stimulation, it has a <em>full</em> sound and
that is something a lot of other music I listen to doesn&rsquo;t seem to
have. I often describe the music that Strapping Young Lad makes as
&ldquo;insane vocals&rdquo; on top of a &ldquo;wall of sound&rdquo; (the latter phrase was
stolen). The guitars and the other instruments are relatively very
loud and Devin Townsend layers synthesizers and other sounds on top of
this making the final sound a complex amalgam that hits all the right
parts of the ear. Of course, Strapping Young Lad isn&rsquo;t necessarily
Death metal, except perhaps their self-titled album. A lot of modern
Death metal has a similar approach, often without synths and other
instruments. Vocals are loud too but this approach diminishes reliance
on exclusively vocals for setting the theme. It&rsquo;s as if all
instruments are involved in developing the final sound, and yes, this
includes the bass guitar too. This, for me, means I get music that
tickles all those brain cells simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="3-dot-mood-based-listening">3. Mood-based listening</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really liked to label bands or albums because most genre
tags can be reductive and restrictive. To me, Death metal encompasses
not just conventionally recognised bands such as Deicide, Obituary and
Death, but others that have a certain sound blended into their own
styles. I&rsquo;d mentioned <em>SYL</em> by Strapping Young Lad earlier and that to
me has elements of this sound. What is this sound? It&rsquo;s one or more
guitars playing a brand of aggressive, typically complex riffs with a
lot of <em>chug</em> and tremolo-picked phrases thrown in. The guitars aren&rsquo;t
slurred into the ambience like in Black metal but clear enough that it
doesn&rsquo;t take too much effort to try and figure them out. Additionally,
there&rsquo;s usually equally aggressive, double kick drums with the
occasional blast beat with the entire sound of the kicks (including
the triggers) heard distinctly; and the bass <strong>audibly</strong> thumping out a
similar riff as what is played on the guitars, on the lower octave of
course. It isn&rsquo;t so much about the speed as much as the aggressiveness
to the sound.</p>
<p>But even within Death metal, there&rsquo;s a wide variety of bands to choose
from, each with a fairly unique sound of their own, but more
importantly collections vastly different emotions that each of them
evoke.</p>
<p>Imagine two guitarists on the front-facing corners of a stage with a
drummer somewhere in the middle and a bassist slightly off-centre
stage. There doesn&rsquo;t even need to be long hair or inverted crosses or
satanic symbols anywhere. The backdrop could be unintelligible text
like the Chat Pile logo here</p>
<p><a href="../../../images/chat_pile.jpg">https://imgur.com/gallery/TFUmClD</a></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>My music tastes are supremely <em>personal</em> and that I&rsquo;m unabashedly
selfish about it. I can talk about it, discussing the physical
experiences and associations I have with the sound on platforms
like twitter or Mastodon, but never in-person, except with a short
list of people I know appreciate discussions about this, at varying
depths.</li>
<li>The music I listen to at any given point of time is solely
dependant on how or what I&rsquo;m feeling at that point of time and that
it can change without warning. Since I don&rsquo;t only listen to Death
metal, I could sound entirely disinterested in it occasionally.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t end here. Even within Death metal, I often have to
spend some time to identify what band or album to listen to because I
form deep-rooted associations with the sound of each album or
band. Only some bands sound right for me. Before I started writing
this article, I went though some 20-odd artists looking for one artist
that was known to make longer and more intricate Death metal songs
despite being one of the first wave. I haven&rsquo;t found it yet (and
anyone that reads this, if you know what I&rsquo;m talking about, do hit me
up on Mastodon). But then I settled into <em>Descend into Depravity</em> by
Morbid Angel and <em>Pierced from Within</em> by Suffocation and they&rsquo;ve worked
great!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when I don&rsquo;t find the right Death metal, and I&rsquo;m incessantly
shuffling though Spotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fans also like&rdquo; or the abomination this is
their landing screen, on my phone, that I feel like that discomfort
returns. This must be a neurodivergent thing because no-one else I&rsquo;ve
met has ever shared anything even remotely similar.</p>
