    <p>Since my laptop is an ancient clay tablet that can barely run Emacs
and a couple of other things without everything crashing, I&rsquo;ve had to
use a lab workstation with about 128 GB RAM and a fairly new Intel
processor for running some of my analyses. It&rsquo;s phenomenally fast for
a computer that runs Windows and gets most things done easily. It&rsquo;s
only when I run something that&rsquo;s something memory intensive when
things really start to get muddled up. I could just be incredibly bad
at R programming but boy, it hit 105 GB of the RAM and slowed the hell
down. It&rsquo;s been like this since last night and now there&rsquo;s nothing I
can do but wait. Surely a Linux or FreeBSD system would have had lower
core functioning thresholds for all of this.</p>
<p>Another fairly weird detail was that it was set to use a UK keyboard
layout unlike almost any PC that&rsquo;s made in these parts. It was so easy
to change but almost no-one had it figured until I got here.</p>
