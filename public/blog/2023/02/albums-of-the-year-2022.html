    <p>I dread publishing lists of this kind especially because ranking
things was never something I enjoyed and since I have a tendency to
forget artists and albums, often even those that I listen to
regularly. I also remember bands by sound and almost inevitably refuse
to keep track of when artists I like release new music. This is in no
sense complete nor could I get myself to write about each of the
albums — I’ll perhaps get down to this sometime later. There is no
ranking within this list for the same reasons as before</p>
<h2 id="ken-mode-null">KEN mode - Null</h2>
<p>Exasperated with everything good in life going to dogs? Throw Your
Phone in the River! It’s noisy, ambient with an abundance of harsh
industrial sounds blended into the background, delivered with bleak,
sludgy instrumentation. This time they’re a four piece, with the
addition of Kathryn Kerr bringing in the saxophone and it expectedly
sounds great with this brand of metal. This release also marks a
stylistic shift from their typically outright angry sound to this
tinge of despair in the way the vocals are delivered.</p>

<h2 id="primitive-man-insurmountable">Primitive Man - Insurmountable</h2>
<p>From practitioners of the most brutal form of Death/Sludge arguably
pioneered by them, the latest offering from Primitive Man bludgeons
the anxieties and dread that came with the pandemic into a
slow-burning, gloomy and angry 4 track record. Their sound appears to
have been perfected over the years into the combination of oppressive
mammoth-like riffs, a loud menacing bass, copious amounts of guitar
feedback and noise samples embedded into the background, and drums
with the hint of a twang on the snare leaving the listener in an
atmosphere dripping with tension and apprehension. McCarthy’s vocals
are as wild as ever — there’s undertones of the sludge scream, the
black metal snarl, alloyed with the Death-growl into guttural lows and
highs. This album also includes a cover of “Quiet” by the Smashing
Pumpkins.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1938079692/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Ethan McCarthy’s other project — Vermin Womb — also saw a new release
that I’d also recommend. It’s similar sounding in the instrumentation
and overall feel but has songs with a more blackened and chaotic
Grindcore style.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=428389777/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="drowse-wane-into-it">Drowse - Wane into It</h2>
<p>I know no better words to describe this than lucid dream-like.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3404655629/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="kathryn-mohr-holly">Kathryn Mohr - Holly</h2>
<p>Liminal perhaps describes the kind of music Kathryn Mohr makes
accurately and in a single word but it’s got a lot more to it. I find
that listening to this album when I need to unwind makes the process a
lot easier and a great deal more enjoyable, but I’m inevitably left
craving more. Holly has droney chords strummed on a Jazzmaster (?),
fuzzy and exclusively on neck pickups — and I feel like I shouldn’t
have to describe this any further but I’ll just add that it takes the
edge off the typical bright tone. This perfectly compliments haunting,
layered vocals that sometimes sound off-key. The vocals don’t appear
to be too central to her sound and songs are often instrumental,
overlaid with pretty synth riffs and crucially set in a brown-noise
base. Also worth noting is the way tracks are arranged in the style of
a cassette release — both sides have short instrumental introductory
pieces and is available as a cassette on her Bandcamp!</p>

</iframe>

<h2 id="chat-pile-god-s-country">Chat Pile - God&rsquo;s Country</h2>
<p>What hasn’t been said about the Purple man that took the world by
storm with their debut album, under the Flenser label, no less. Heavy
guitars and skull numbing reverb laden drums thumping out slow and
dark songs about despair and the anti-anthem “Why”. Needless to say,
I’m sold on the Purple Man.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1845795607/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="miscreance-convergence">Miscreance - Convergence</h2>
<p>I came across them when the Dead Neanderthals tweeted</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not enough people are talking about this album. <br><br>A perfect mix of Death (Human era), Pestilence (Consvming era) and Revenant!<a href="https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ">https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ</a></p>&mdash; Dead Neanderthals (also on bsky.app) (@deadneanderthal) <a href="https://twitter.com/deadneanderthal/status/1620492647025758210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>and I’m in full agreement. Being the dedicated Death fan (for life),
this does indeed sound like Chuck Schuldiner performed the
vocals. Both Pestilence and Death drips off their thrashy, bass-heavy
minor key riffs.</p>

</iframe>

<h2 id="mamaleek-diner-coffee">Mamaleek - Diner Coffee (?)</h2>
<p>As the Flenser repeatedly tweets, Who is Mamaleek?. Weird noisey and
dark but it’s really hard to describe them without sounding insane.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=798925787/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="meshuggah-immutable">Meshuggah - Immutable</h2>
<p>I came to realise they had a new release out when I saw and absurd
“meme” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX4GOltUDdA">video</a> on Youtube. It’s got the usual sick groove but I could
have sworn a pronounced blackening to their riffs.</p>

    </div>

<h2 id="wormrot-hiss">Wormrot - Hiss</h2>
<p>It’s got everything a Wormrot album promises in grindcore, but this
release felt more mellow as compared to the brutally fast and precise
riffing/drums from earlier releases.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4060129622/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="exhumed-to-the-dead">Exhumed - To The Dead</h2>
<p>Morbidly groovy and detuned Death/Grind, often reminiscent of
Carcass’s very old grindcore delivers human entrails yet again. 2022
has been a prolonged fangirling moment for Doktor Ross Sewage and
every band he’s played with. His twitter feed is never boring.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=544623389/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="russian-circles-gnosis">Russian Circles - Gnosis</h2>
<p>Post-metal but it often sounds black and heavy.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2146782469/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="wake-thought-form-descent">Wake - Thought Form Descent</h2>
<p>There’s no words I can conjure to describe Wake humanly. It’s got
everything — sickeningly catchy riffs like grindcore, dark ambient
black metal and post-metal — but then there’s so much more. It’s loud
and hits you like a tidal wave but is also meditative of sorts.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2062431084/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="hath-all-that-was-promised">Hath - All That Was Promised</h2>
<p>Modern Death metal that is blackened and sometimes slightly
technical. There are mellow passages too but ultimately the album
feels not as abstract as older Death metal and betrays a sort of
sorrow.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1846091399/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="mares-of-thrace-the-exile">Mares of Thrace - The Exile</h2>
<p>This was easily one of the most tension filled, deathy Doom metal
records of my year.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1897908051/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="heriot-profound-mortality">Heriot - Profound Mortality</h2>
<p>Hard to pin down but it’s black, hardcore and deranged.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3401809514/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="hexis-aeturnum">Hexis - Aeturnum</h2>
<p>Unabashedly Satanic, these black metallers deliver the loudest and
fullest sounding black metal record I’ve heard in a while. The air is
heavy and icy but the vocals hit like a draft from a furnace.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2425494646/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="cloud-rat-threshold">Cloud Rat - Threshold</h2>
<p>Chaos!</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1954585202/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="scarcity-aveilut">Scarcity - Aveilut</h2>
<p>Bleak, just the way post-black metal should be. This was an early
contender for the list.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=620818614/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="thou-and-mizmor-myopia">Thou &amp; Mizmor - Myopia</h2>
<p>Trepidation and tension does make one myopic. Doom with a good deal of
sludge mixed in, this is bleak and heavy.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3344058140/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<h2 id="thoughtcrimes-altered-pasts">thoughtcrimes - Altered Pasts</h2>
<p>Chaotic but with some vague semblance to the newer Alice in Chains -
post Robert DuVall’s joining. Thoroughly noise like the label
indicates.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=498311509/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
