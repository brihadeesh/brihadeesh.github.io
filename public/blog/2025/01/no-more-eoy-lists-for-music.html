  <article>
    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote for the blog and even longer since I
made an end-of-year list but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about these
lists. I&rsquo;ve published just one from a <a href="../../../blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html">couple of years back</a> and then
never really published one on the blog and it has been something of a
conscious decision. I would perhaps like to move towards writing more
meaningful pieces on individual albums or sets of albums I&rsquo;ve been
listening to and have gotten to appreciate. Making EOY lists has been
exhausting and I&rsquo;m never entirely sure if I&rsquo;ve missed out on any
albums since I don&rsquo;t really keep track of what I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>In that vein, I&rsquo;d perhaps like to talk about what I&rsquo;ve been listening
to off-late. I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a break from work and things have
gotten tedious in the place I&rsquo;ve been living in for the last few
months. Having to put up with people I don&rsquo;t really want to be around
and getting endless unsolicited advice has left me frustrated. And so
I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of RABM and, in general, black metal such
as Mare Cognitum and Paysage d&rsquo;Hiver. Also peep the new and upcoming
Bandcamp replacement, <a href="https://ampwall.com">Ampwall</a> which <a href="https://ampwall.com/u/clg666">Chris Grigg</a> has been developing.</p>

<p><a href="https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com">Paysage d&rsquo;Hiver</a> has been especially dear to me since I discovered them
last year and their newest release, Die Berge, clocking in at just an
hour unlike <a href="https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com/album/im-wald">Im Wald</a>, my previously favourite album of theirs which was
way longer, has been on repeat.</p>

</iframe>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been listening to Trhä a little along with other similar raw
black metal acts such as <a href="https://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com">Lamp of Murmuur</a> and <a href="https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter">Wolven Daughter</a>.</p>

<p>What really has kept me going through this weird time is at the
intersection of sludge, hardcore, death metal and black metal. Here&rsquo;s
a sample of what kind of music I&rsquo;ve been listening to over the last
week, for example. I would like to highlight a few albums and artists
from these, and others I listened to recently, over the course of this
article.</p>
<h3 id="revulsion-revulsion">Revulsion - Revulsion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d recently made a more or less permanent switch to Bluesky from
Twitter and I&rsquo;ve been talking about and exchanging music with people
I&rsquo;ve known from Twitter and new people I&rsquo;ve met. Amongst the albums
that came up recently has been Revulsion&rsquo;s self-titled album that was
released in February 2021. I picked this up from one of Westin&rsquo;s posts
a few weeks back and I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with the title track.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2559093933/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>The Finnish band, signed to Transcending Obscurity Records, plays a
style of death metal that is hard to put into any one sub-genre
label. It has elements of the old school Florida style but they refuse
to let that hold them back from blending a very strong groove with
double kick beats and slightly dissonant guitars.</p>
<h3 id="llnn-unmaker">LLNN - Unmaker</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3718097988/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Tim from Bluesky talks about *-core bands a lot but when he mentioned
the sludge band LLNN, which I&rsquo;ve had on my list for a fairly long
time, I realised I should check it out. When I did post about it, he
replied asking if I could recommend any other similar sounding
music. I did suggest bands such as Gaza, Oldspeak, and others that
have been in regular rotation for me but it was only when Gary
Davidson entered the conversation that we found some very interesting
music. More about those in a bit but getting back to <em>Unmaker</em>, it&rsquo;s a
phenomenal record that blends elements of sludge with hardcore making
it crushingly heavy and oppressive. I&rsquo;d recommend listening to this
when one is horrendously frustrated and needs something to help cope
with the exasperation that comes with it. This was released in
September 2021.</p>
<h3 id="coilguns-odd-love">Coilguns - Odd Love</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=54361543/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be very honest that I have no clue what kind of music this is but
I just loved how the whole record had a kind of groove that makes you
want to just get up and dance. The tags show alternative noise, noise
rock, and something to do with punk and hardcore so maybe that might
make things clearer. It was another album that Tim mentioned a bunch
of times and so I just ended up listening to it. This was released in
November 2024.</p>
<h3 id="admiral-angry-buster">Admiral Angry - Buster</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4071850960/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>One of Gary&rsquo;s recommendations, this is a really loud and noise-ey
sludge record that blows your brains out. Throw it on if you liked
LLNN&rsquo;s Unmaker and Primitive Man. The album is from June 2018.</p>
<h3 id="mico-zigurat">MICO - Zigurat</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2196194472/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>I had realised that I hadn&rsquo;t bought Cave Sermon&rsquo;s <a href="https://cavesermon.bandcamp.com/album/divine-laughter">latest</a> so when I
went to their Bandcamp page I saw that they&rsquo;d recommended a few other
albums. MICO&rsquo;s <em>Zigurat</em> was one of them. What really drew me to this
project was how they&rsquo;d infused sludge with grindcore seamlessly and
much like others that play this kind of metal (like Gaza) they&rsquo;d
pulled it off spectacularly. I really don&rsquo;t know much about them but
they&rsquo;re definitely one of my best finds. The album was released in
June 2022.</p>
<h3 id="luminesce-mirrored">Luminesce - Mirrored</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2604555405/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>There are very few people that are into technical death metal that
haven&rsquo;t heard of Alice Simard, a 20 year old Canadian
multi-instrumentalist who has one of the most impressive discographies
I&rsquo;ve ever come across. Her <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Alice_Simard/813803">Metal Archives</a> page should tell you more
than enough about that. She typically plays a style of technical death
metal that has neoclassical elements amongst other styles but this is
a melodic death metal record with some of the most curious production
choices. Her death metal records usually have a very prominent bass in
the mix and in the case of this album, it elevates the sound to a very
nearly magical realm. This record was published on the first day
of 2025.</p>
<h3 id="filesharemaiden-veuve">Filesharemaiden - Veuve</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2795493961/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Released in June 2024, this is another phenomenal Alice Simard project
that Max Svalgard from the band <a href="https://sublation.bandcamp.com">Sublation</a> introduced me to earlier
in 2023. The project has put out a few split LPs of which I had played
<a href="https://filesharemaiden.bandcamp.com/album/uterokinesis">Uterokinesis</a>. Simard plays a kind of technical death metal with the
same prominent bass sound in the mix. She makes a wall of sound with
the guitars, drums and vocals on the one hand and that overlaid with
the bass sound makes for a very interesting listening experience. It&rsquo;s
also interesting that Filesharemaiden has morphed from what used to be
a brutal death metal project into this.</p>
<h3 id="gonemage-entranced-by-the-ice-storm">Gonemage - Entranced by the Ice Storm</h3>
<iframe style="width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;"
    src="https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=0193f0d6-f81f-7770-8dbe-88c25e32011c&controlStyle=persistent&playerWidth=350" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Garry Brents has only put out the best nu-metal since I first got
acquainted with them in 2023, when I&rsquo;d come across a post of theirs on
Twitter teasing Memorrhage&rsquo;s <a href="https://ampwall.com/a/memorrhage/album/memorrhage">self-titled debut</a> in a short video. His
music has since carved out a regular presence in my listening
habits. This EP is a teaser to a new phase of Gonemage, their black
metal and chiptune project (yeah, it sounds super fucking
interesting), in which they&rsquo;ve moved to a more Emperor and
Dødheimsgard-esque sound. I am very excited to hear the full length
album that is to follow. The EP was released on the first Friday of
this year.</p>
<h3 id="sallow-moth-vial">Sallow Moth - Vial</h3>
<iframe style="width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;"
    src="https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=01922f38-1c7a-7d22-82b9-1871a064ecff&controlStyle=persistent&playerWidth=350" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Sallow Moth is Garry&rsquo;s death metal project and this EP from October
2024 is again a prelude to a full-length that is to follow. It&rsquo;s
brutal, it&rsquo;s techy, and it&rsquo;s got clean passages. If you enjoyed <a href="https://ampwall.com/a/sallowmoth/album/stasis-cocoon">Stasis
Cocoon</a>, this is nothing like it.</p>
<h3 id="tumultuous-ruin-an-abscess-on-the-heart-of-the-state">Tumultuous Ruin - An Abscess on the Heart of the State</h3>
<iframe style="width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;"
    src="https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=0191e9bf-3eab-7ee0-852f-82bb560b5c0d&controlStyle=persistent&playerWidth=350" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>RABM is something I got into fairly recently but this one man project
has been a part of my regular listening habits since it came out back
in September 2023. I&rsquo;m unable to recall who really put me onto it but
I have the strongest feeling that this was something Violet from
<a href="https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter">Wolven Daughter</a> mentioned last year, which then reminded me about how
much I enjoyed this.</p>
<h3 id="fathomless-fathomless">Fathomless - Fathomless</h3>
<iframe style="width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;"
    src="https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=01934188-0ab2-7a30-9d1f-e3186f1330cd&controlStyle=persistent&playerWidth=350" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>I found this amongst some of the announcements for new albums on
Ampwall that their Bluesky profile posts occasionally and I just wound
up listening to it. They play a kind of progressive or technical black
metal that is actually not grating. The record came out in September 2024.</p>
<h3 id="apocalyptic-leaders-exists-in-chaos">Apocalyptic Leaders - Exists in Chaos</h3>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;"
    src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=905424846/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless>
</iframe>

<p>Violet from Wolven Daughter was talking about this album on Bluesky,
and about something in the water in Greece that makes some of the best
black metal in the world. I ended up playing it soon after. A kind of
black metal that is aggressive and deathy. It even feels like death
metal at some points. The album was released in June 2024</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for what I&rsquo;ve been listening to off-late. I
hope I end up making it a habit to write up pieces like this!</p>
