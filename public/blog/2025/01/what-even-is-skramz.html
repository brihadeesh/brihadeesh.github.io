    <p>The last week has been eventful and has seen a ton of new releases out
of which I&rsquo;ve listened to probably just an album or two. There was a
<a href="https://putriddefecation.bandcamp.com/album/tales-from-the-toilet">toilet themed slam band</a> that put out something with some really sick
riffs. There was the album from Serein that used a painting by Thomas
Cole called &ldquo;The Voyage of Life: Old Age&rdquo; from 1942 as their cover
art. Most people that checked it out, complained that it had clean
vocals, something not everyone appreciates in death metal.</p>

<p>This painting, however, was first used by Candlemass on their
phenomenal 1987 album <a href="https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/nightfall">Nightfall</a> and that led to some hilarious
reactions from people on Bluesky.</p>
