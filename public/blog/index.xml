      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last week has been eventful and has seen a ton of new releases out
of which I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to probably just an album or two. There was the
album from Serein that used a painting by Thomas Cole called &amp;ldquo;The
Voyage of Life: Old Age&amp;rdquo; from 1942 as their cover art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../images/serein_candlemass_cover.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This painting, however, was first used by Candlemass on their
phenomenal 1987 album &lt;a href=&#34;https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/nightfall&#34;&gt;Nightfall&lt;/a&gt; and that led to some hilarious
reactions from people on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;bluesky-embed&#34; data-bluesky-uri=&#34;at://did:plc:3ff4uii2g5w3bkew4y2iexcq/app.bsky.feed.post/3lfxa6yo7mk2h&#34; data-bluesky-cid=&#34;bafyreiccjfhiryxa4d6vyavb3zvosgcx7ecykpwrm2saeea7yiqfrohbl4&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;Very pleased to announce that I&amp;#39;ve narrowed my album artwork down to these four public domain options!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote for the blog and even longer since I
made an end-of-year list but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about these
lists. I&amp;rsquo;ve published just one from a &lt;a href=&#34;../blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html&#34;&gt;couple of years back&lt;/a&gt; and then
never really published one on the blog and it has been something of a
conscious decision. I would perhaps like to move towards writing more
meaningful pieces on individual albums or sets of albums I&amp;rsquo;ve been
listening to and have gotten to appreciate. Making EOY lists has been
exhausting and I&amp;rsquo;m never entirely sure if I&amp;rsquo;ve missed out on any
albums since I don&amp;rsquo;t really keep track of what I really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I&amp;rsquo;d perhaps like to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening
to off-late. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a break from work and things have
gotten tedious in the place I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in for the last few
months. Having to put up with people I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to be around
and getting endless unsolicited advice has left me frustrated. And so
I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of RABM and, in general, black metal such
as Mare Cognitum and Paysage d&amp;rsquo;Hiver. Also peep the new and upcoming
Bandcamp replacement, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com&#34;&gt;Ampwall&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com/u/clg666&#34;&gt;Chris Grigg&lt;/a&gt; has been developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=08035ba3-1e77-4cf4-bdb3-1606fb383d10&amp;controlStyle=persistent&amp;playerWidth=350&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Paysage d&amp;rsquo;Hiver&lt;/a&gt; has been especially dear to me since I discovered them
last year and their newest release, Die Berge, clocking in at just an
hour unlike &lt;a href=&#34;https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com/album/im-wald&#34;&gt;Im Wald&lt;/a&gt;, my previously favourite album of theirs which was
way longer, has been on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3412815069/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been listening to Trhä a little along with other similar raw
black metal acts such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Lamp of Murmuur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter&#34;&gt;Wolven Daughter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1127265503/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-ve-really-been-listening-to&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve really been listening to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../images/week2_2025.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really has kept me going through this weird time is at the
intersection of sludge, hardcore, death metal and black metal. Here&amp;rsquo;s
a sample of what kind of music I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to over the last
week, for example. I would like to highlight a few albums and artists
from these, and others I listened to recently, over the course of this
article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;revulsion-revulsion&#34;&gt;Revulsion - Revulsion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d recently made a more or less permanent switch to Bluesky from
Twitter and I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about and exchanging music with people
I&amp;rsquo;ve known from Twitter and new people I&amp;rsquo;ve met. Amongst the albums
that came up recently has been Revulsion&amp;rsquo;s self-titled album that was
released in February 2021. I picked this up from one of Westin&amp;rsquo;s posts
a few weeks back and I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with the title track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2559093933/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Finnish band, signed to Transcending Obscurity Records, plays a
style of death metal that is hard to put into any one sub-genre
label. It has elements of the old school Florida style but they refuse
to let that hold them back from blending a very strong groove with
double kick beats and slightly dissonant guitars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;llnn-unmaker&#34;&gt;LLNN - Unmaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3718097988/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim from Bluesky talks about *-core bands a lot but when he mentioned
the sludge band LLNN, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had on my list for a fairly long
time, I realised I should check it out. When I did post about it, he
replied asking if I could recommend any other similar sounding
music. I did suggest bands such as Gaza, Oldspeak, and others that
have been in regular rotation for me but it was only when Gary
Davidson entered the conversation that we found some very interesting
music. More about those in a bit but getting back to &lt;em&gt;Unmaker&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a
phenomenal record that blends elements of sludge with hardcore making
it crushingly heavy and oppressive. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend listening to this
when one is horrendously frustrated and needs something to help cope
with the exasperation that comes with it. This was released in
September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coilguns-odd-love&#34;&gt;Coilguns - Odd Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=54361543/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be very honest that I have no clue what kind of music this is but
I just loved how the whole record had a kind of groove that makes you
want to just get up and dance. The tags show alternative noise, noise
rock, and something to do with punk and hardcore so maybe that might
make things clearer. It was another album that Tim mentioned a bunch
of times and so I just ended up listening to it. This was released in
November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admiral-angry-buster&#34;&gt;Admiral Angry - Buster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4071850960/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Gary&amp;rsquo;s recommendations, this is a really loud and noise-ey
sludge record that blows your brains out. Throw it on if you liked
LLNN&amp;rsquo;s Unmaker and Primitive Man. The album is from June 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mico-zigurat&#34;&gt;MICO - Zigurat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2196194472/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had realised that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bought Cave Sermon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cavesermon.bandcamp.com/album/divine-laughter&#34;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; so when I
went to their Bandcamp page I saw that they&amp;rsquo;d recommended a few other
albums. MICO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Zigurat&lt;/em&gt; was one of them. What really drew me to this
project was how they&amp;rsquo;d infused sludge with grindcore seamlessly and
much like others that play this kind of metal (like Gaza) they&amp;rsquo;d
pulled it off spectacularly. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about them but
they&amp;rsquo;re definitely one of my best finds. The album was released in
June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;luminesce-mirrored&#34;&gt;Luminesce - Mirrored&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2604555405/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few people that are into technical death metal that
haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Alice Simard, a 20 year old Canadian
multi-instrumentalist who has one of the most impressive discographies
I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come across. Her &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Alice_Simard/813803&#34;&gt;Metal Archives&lt;/a&gt; page should tell you more
than enough about that. She typically plays a style of technical death
metal that has neoclassical elements amongst other styles but this is
a melodic death metal record with some of the most curious production
choices. Her death metal records usually have a very prominent bass in
the mix and in the case of this album, it elevates the sound to a very
nearly magical realm. This record was published on the first day
of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filesharemaiden-veuve&#34;&gt;Filesharemaiden - Veuve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2795493961/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in June 2024, this is another phenomenal Alice Simard project
that Max Svalgard from the band &lt;a href=&#34;https://sublation.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Sublation&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to earlier
in 2023. The project has put out a few split LPs of which I had played
&lt;a href=&#34;https://filesharemaiden.bandcamp.com/album/uterokinesis&#34;&gt;Uterokinesis&lt;/a&gt;. Simard plays a kind of technical death metal with the
same prominent bass sound in the mix. She makes a wall of sound with
the guitars, drums and vocals on the one hand and that overlaid with
the bass sound makes for a very interesting listening experience. It&amp;rsquo;s
also interesting that Filesharemaiden has morphed from what used to be
a brutal death metal project into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gonemage-entranced-by-the-ice-storm&#34;&gt;Gonemage - Entranced by the Ice Storm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=0193f0d6-f81f-7770-8dbe-88c25e32011c&amp;controlStyle=persistent&amp;playerWidth=350&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garry Brents has only put out the best nu-metal since I first got
acquainted with them in 2023, when I&amp;rsquo;d come across a post of theirs on
Twitter teasing Memorrhage&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com/a/memorrhage/album/memorrhage&#34;&gt;self-titled debut&lt;/a&gt; in a short video. His
music has since carved out a regular presence in my listening
habits. This EP is a teaser to a new phase of Gonemage, their black
metal and chiptune project (yeah, it sounds super fucking
interesting), in which they&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a more Emperor and
Dødheimsgard-esque sound. I am very excited to hear the full length
album that is to follow. The EP was released on the first Friday of
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sallow-moth-vial&#34;&gt;Sallow Moth - Vial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=01922f38-1c7a-7d22-82b9-1871a064ecff&amp;controlStyle=persistent&amp;playerWidth=350&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sallow Moth is Garry&amp;rsquo;s death metal project and this EP from October
2024 is again a prelude to a full-length that is to follow. It&amp;rsquo;s
brutal, it&amp;rsquo;s techy, and it&amp;rsquo;s got clean passages. If you enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com/a/sallowmoth/album/stasis-cocoon&#34;&gt;Stasis
Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;, this is nothing like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tumultuous-ruin-an-abscess-on-the-heart-of-the-state&#34;&gt;Tumultuous Ruin - An Abscess on the Heart of the State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=0191e9bf-3eab-7ee0-852f-82bb560b5c0d&amp;controlStyle=persistent&amp;playerWidth=350&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RABM is something I got into fairly recently but this one man project
has been a part of my regular listening habits since it came out back
in September 2023. I&amp;rsquo;m unable to recall who really put me onto it but
I have the strongest feeling that this was something Violet from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter&#34;&gt;Wolven Daughter&lt;/a&gt; mentioned last year, which then reminded me about how
much I enjoyed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fathomless-fathomless&#34;&gt;Fathomless - Fathomless&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;width: 350px; min-width: 350px; height: 502px; min-height: 502px; border: 0;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://ampwall.com/services/PlayerCard/v1/content?albumId=01934188-0ab2-7a30-9d1f-e3186f1330cd&amp;controlStyle=persistent&amp;playerWidth=350&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this amongst some of the announcements for new albums on
Ampwall that their Bluesky profile posts occasionally and I just wound
up listening to it. They play a kind of progressive or technical black
metal that is actually not grating. The record came out in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apocalyptic-leaders-exists-in-chaos&#34;&gt;Apocalyptic Leaders - Exists in Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=905424846/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violet from Wolven Daughter was talking about this album on Bluesky,
and about something in the water in Greece that makes some of the best
black metal in the world. I ended up playing it soon after. A kind of
black metal that is aggressive and deathy. It even feels like death
metal at some points. The album was released in June 2024&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve got for what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to off-late. I
hope I end up making it a habit to write up pieces like this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d decided to give up on my free WordPress blog a while back, after
having watched a SystemCrafters &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/AfkrzFodoNw&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on how to blog from Emacs (&lt;em&gt;d&amp;rsquo;oh&lt;/em&gt;,
I just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do everything from Emacs). Of course, daviwil only
covered the basics of writing and exporting using Emacs&amp;rsquo; built-in
packages and later for deploying it on GitHub / Sourcehut pages. And
it took me a good year to get down to making the switch but apparently
moving to a new place for work is the motivation it required. It felt
like cheating to use Jekyll on GitHub and I wanted something that
could be deployed to a Sourcehut site easily too (Sourcehut blocks any
CDN-based CSS loaded into the site&amp;rsquo;s HTML) and I wanted something
extremely minimal, like Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; but with even fewer
frills — no images anywhere except for if a blog post required
them. Looking at his blog source, however, made me realise that there
was a lot more to that minimalism than one could see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-setup&#34;&gt;Basic setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has come through fairly well, so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve got an &lt;a href=&#34;../emacs/emacs-literate-configuration/#ox-hugo-since-the-go-org-keep-wrecking-up-links&#34;&gt;org-capture
setup&lt;/a&gt; for this that links up every new entry captured into a master
posts file, adding all the relevant info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs-lisp&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;with-eval-after-load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;org-capture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;          &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Returns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;`org-capture&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; template string for new Hugo post.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;        See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;`org-capture-templates&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; for more information.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;let*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;read-from-minibuffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Post Title: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;Prompt to enter the post title&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;          &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;org-capture-templates&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hugo blog post&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;file+olp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;~/my_gits/brihadeesh.github.io/content-org/blog/posts.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Posts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exporting to markdown (Org just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good enough support
yet), tags and organisation of pages into bundles is handled by
ox-hugo &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The
header arguments in the capture template cover everything. With
Emacs&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;.dir-locals.el&lt;/code&gt; feature, a file of that name in the home
directory of the blog ensures every new entry or modification into the
master posts file gets auto-exported to markdown on save. The contents
are quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs-lisp&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; ~/.dir-locals.el&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;content-org/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;org-hugo-auto-export-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Emacs&amp;rsquo;s Org mode, this posts file has subheadings under a
&lt;em&gt;Posts&lt;/em&gt; header, each of which is a blog post and is exported to a
sub-directory under &lt;code&gt;~/content/posts/&lt;/code&gt; as a lone &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; keeping with
the page-bundle kind of organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;tree&lt;/code&gt; run for the content directory shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ tree content

own while the home-page is the sole &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; in the same. What I&amp;rsquo;ve
got going feels a little hacky but I&amp;rsquo;ll figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;automatic-deployment&#34;&gt;Automatic deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo, being a static site generator, creates HTML exports into
&lt;code&gt;~/public&lt;/code&gt; and this is what the site uses. All major git hosting
services have configurable CI/CD for deploying these to the domain and
they&amp;rsquo;re run automatically if you have a specific file in either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the root directory of the repo for Sourcehut called &lt;code&gt;.build.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.github/workflows/&lt;/code&gt; for GitHub called anything you want with a
&lt;code&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine uses &lt;code&gt;github-pages&lt;/code&gt; and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;github pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot to fix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heading anchors on top-level pages are superfluous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe consider switching to a theme-agnostic setup like Drew&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get rid of unnecessary indentation like in the table of contents and headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add anchors even to lower level headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch to a Sourcehut site (eventually and when I can afford it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-reading&#34;&gt;Further reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is but a blog post written, and edited, within half an hour so I
likely haven&amp;rsquo;t covered a lot of important things. I&amp;rsquo;ll add some links
to others&amp;rsquo; blog posts that discuss using this or documentation as I
come across them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ox-hugo.scripter.co&#34;&gt;ox-hugo.scripter.co&lt;/a&gt;. This is a
wonderful package for Emacs written by Kaushal Modi &lt;a href=&#34;https:scripter.co&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve opted for this over &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org&#34;&gt;go-org&lt;/a&gt;, the native Org backend for
Hugo since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support some basic Org syntax exports&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
