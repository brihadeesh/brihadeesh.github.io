      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert-info alert&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footnotes point to placeholders currently. I&amp;rsquo;ll fill those in
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was starkly aware of how my last post, &lt;a href=&#34;../blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode.html&#34;&gt;Notes from a withdrawal
episode&lt;/a&gt;, felt somewhat incomplete but couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what
it was that was &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; from it. Someone on twitter had asked
whether being on the medication was of any help and I responded to
this saying it was too large a topic to cover in tweets and that it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I could address on twitter — it would involve really
gathering my thoughts and writing a thread there while doing so
perhaps felt daunting at that point. It still took me a while to
figure out what was missing from my last post was something of a
description of what being on Methylphenidate was like and so I decided
to write this post about it as something of a &lt;em&gt;prequel&lt;/em&gt; to my last
post. Like I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned to the person that had asked that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
as straightforward an answer as &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist had initially started me off on a course of
Atomoxetine when I got the diagnosis and it felt like it helped
initially, because of the novelty of it, I imagine. Regardless, it
took me a while to understand that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me, perhaps
owing to the other drug I was on — Sertraline, a powerful SSRI
commonly known by its generic name Zoloft — which often left me
feeling groggy and exhausted all the time. It was when my doctor
started me off on Methylphenidate that I started seeing consistent
changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is a powerful stimulant and tricky to procure considering it
is an amphetamine. The relationship between ADHD and powerful
stimulants is interesting. People with ADHD typically have lower
levels of dopamine and vastly limited means to access it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dopamine is the &amp;ldquo;reward&amp;rdquo; hormone and is automatically
released by the brain when one does activities they enjoy but this
release pathway isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or functional for someone with
ADHD.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In order to artificially regulate dopamine
levels, stimulants such as amphetamines are used to hack the automatic
dopamine-high the drug provides as remedy for dysfunctional dopamine
signalling. My doctor got me started on Methylphenidate roughly 8
months back. Lower doses at first, slowly leading up to a steady 40 mg
(50 mg more recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it felt a little exhilarating — possibly owing to the
novelty — but I was fairly certain of a difference in how motivated I
felt. Creative bursts, or hyperfocus sessions for that matter, were
more frequent when I&amp;rsquo;m unmedicated (and not in withdrawal) but they&amp;rsquo;re
also notoriously unreliable. They&amp;rsquo;re too random and unpredictable in
all senses of the word and any attempts at doing things consistency
ultimately fail because the kind of motivation is ultimately moody and
manic. Sometimes, a kind of restlessness overpowers my ability to do
anything meaningful and I&amp;rsquo;m left annoyed and irritable with my brain
on overdrive. The medication, in a sense, helps gather these
unmanageable peaks and troughs and even them out into a more steady
sort of motivation. Oddly enough, I still find that I&amp;rsquo;m more
&lt;em&gt;involved&lt;/em&gt; and capable of things that need more creative solutions in
some of my unmedicated hyperfocus sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m typically well aware of what tasks I&amp;rsquo;m yet to complete and despite
that I&amp;rsquo;m almost never able to get myself to do those things
unmedicated. I can maybe get one, relatively simple task done in the
same short-lived bursts of clarity described earlier but the moment
I&amp;rsquo;m done with it, an irritability and often a kind of anxiety sets in,
possibly stemming from fatigue. For perhaps the first 2-3 months on
the medication, I was able to do some of the larger tasks with ease
although I still needed breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also notice, over the course of the entire period of time I
was on the medication, how I was significantly less preoccupied with
lowered self-esteem and getting carried away into dramatic depressive
states triggered by criticism or rejection (rejection sensitive
dysphoria)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — I even found that I was more
straightforward with dealing with conversations of the sort that
bothered me, especially those involving having my experiences
invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be constantly stimulated externally — a good coffee in the
morning that gets me going and more importantly keeps me alert. I&amp;rsquo;m
more dependent on this while I&amp;rsquo;m off the medication. Thinking back on
it, a large part of what I look for here is some degree of comfort —
as little sources of annoyance and a relatively peaceful space to do
things — to be able to work with any amount of consistency. While on
medication, these stop being needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medication, however, has a few side effects that I&amp;rsquo;ve observed —
there are a lot more that one should look out for, some of these often
quite serious too.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The most prominent of these was
insomnia. I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues with sleep all along but this worsened for
the initial few months on the medication. The only solution that
showed promise in dealing with this was to plan and keep to a regular
routine. Melatonin could potentially help fall asleep but it made me
nauseous on the next day for several hours after waking. This, coupled with
intense withdrawal symptoms are perhaps the biggest issues I faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything, nor was it intended to. There are a few
things I have consciously omitted for the sake of my own
sanity. Regardless, I hope to make this and the other post into a
series I keep adding to periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes from a withdrawal episode</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 23:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading Adrianna&amp;rsquo;s (or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://popagandhi.com/&#34;&gt;Pop22&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo;s) last blog post &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://popagandhi.com/posts/2023-02-attention-span/&#34;&gt;I Now Have an
Attention Span&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; after they asked for new blog feeds they could follow
on the fediverse and I realised I wasn&amp;rsquo;t following their blog anywhere
— I&amp;rsquo;ve since added it everywhere, including in my openring
configuration — and got thinking about a thing or two about my own
progress with ADHD over the last four-odd years since my diagnosis. I
do see something of an arc in my capacity for regular work and keeping
at doing different kinds of work, similar to what they describe, but
I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that there are some things I can stay focused on and work
through. Sadly these have minimal overlap with what I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for my
career. I like working with computers — fooling around with R, trying
to learn e-lisp an figure out Emacs, and well, setting up this blog
too — and it&amp;rsquo;s startling to see how little there is in terms of job
opportunities that involve any of these within ecology or wildlife
science. I realise I&amp;rsquo;m digressing but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make
here is that I find that my attention span having improved applies
only to a very limited kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been roughly two weeks since I ran out of my medication
(Methylphenidate — commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta) and I&amp;rsquo;ve
been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve
been off this since I got started some six months back. I&amp;rsquo;ve had
disturbed sleep (I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at midnight!), heightened anxiety
that often manifests as anxiety attacks, and in general rapid mood
changes and more but I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen some things that were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same kinds of work I thought I could do better has become a whole
lot easier to do now, while I&amp;rsquo;m in this withdrawal state, for the most
part. I also find my thoughts to be clearer and that I no longer miss
out on important cues of various kinds. This is quite irregular but is
in no way sustainable in the long term for myriad reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moved to Sourcehut!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/03/moved-to-sourcehut.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 03:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/03/moved-to-sourcehut.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote to Drew DeVault a couple of days back, after much deliberation
on whether I should really bother him and the like, about free access
to Sourcehut builds so I could move away from Github and Gitlab. He
responded soon after that saying that he&amp;rsquo;d given me a year&amp;rsquo;s
access. And I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it! The blog that started off titled
&lt;em&gt;peregrinator&amp;rsquo;s sourcehut site&lt;/em&gt; along with an explanation on why it was
called that while hosted on Github-pages is finally here! The next
step would be to move to a personal or custom domain of my own, but
that&amp;rsquo;s a long way into the future, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this brings me closer to what I&amp;rsquo;ve got planned for my
internet presence — minimal and without JavaScript. Although I&amp;rsquo;m
pleased with how this has &lt;em&gt;simplified&lt;/em&gt; a lot of things, this also means
a few new things to keep in mind for me and this is perhaps of most
interest here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been honing my command-line git skills over the last few years
but since repository settings are threadbare on Sourcehut, I&amp;rsquo;ll have
to really step up my game here. I&amp;rsquo;ve already faced some minor setbacks
to my work, on this blog incidentally. I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;em&gt;gitignored&lt;/em&gt; the folder with
the Org-mode sources for all of my blog posts and other pages and then
checked out an older version of my blog posts source from the last
commit with the file. Since this was from prior to adding &lt;code&gt;gitignore&lt;/code&gt;
functionality, it was at-least an entry older with a bunch of crucial
changes I&amp;rsquo;d made yesterday. I had to manually recover this eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining multiple branches, juggling remotes - since this shares
its files with those from my older Github-pages site — all was a bit
overwhelming initially but I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to clean up most of the cruft
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get more confident around git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;content-restrictions&#34;&gt;Content restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve taken is the restrictions on third-party
content - see &lt;a href=&#34;../blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html&#34;&gt;Albums of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, my last post for example. The
Sourcehut site documentation states that they disallow external
style-sheets, especially those accessed via CDNs but crucially
third-party embedded content.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t mean
much to most - especially if the content of blog posts is text and
some code - but since some of my posts are about music, I find that
this restriction gets in my way. I cannot add embedded albums or
tracks Bandcamp. Bandcamp is what I prefer when it comes to music
since they&amp;rsquo;re the most artist-friendly amongst streaming
platforms.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve since changed my Bandcamp shortcode from a minimal, single
positional argument based kind to one that uses an additional URL
rendered as a simple link below the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt;. Of course, with Sourcehut
pages, the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; is just a blank rectangle of the same dimensions as
the embedded Bandcamp content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Find them on &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Get &amp;#34;url&amp;#34; }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Bandcamp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;iframe style=&amp;#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&amp;#34;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

affect me as much&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Albums of the Year (2022)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I dread publishing lists of this kind especially because ranking
things was never something I enjoyed and since I have a tendency to
forget artists and albums, often even those that I listen to
regularly. I also remember bands by sound and almost inevitably refuse
to keep track of when artists I like release new music. This is in no
sense complete nor could I get myself to write about each of the
albums — I’ll perhaps get down to this sometime later. There is no
ranking within this list for the same reasons as before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ken-mode-null&#34;&gt;KEN mode - Null&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exasperated with everything good in life going to dogs? Throw Your
Phone in the River! It’s noisy, ambient with an abundance of harsh
industrial sounds blended into the background, delivered with bleak,
sludgy instrumentation. This time they’re a four piece, with the
addition of Kathryn Kerr bringing in the saxophone and it expectedly
sounds great with this brand of metal. This release also marks a
stylistic shift from their typically outright angry sound to this
tinge of despair in the way the vocals are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kenmode.bandcamp.com/album/null&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3317743233/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;primitive-man-insurmountable&#34;&gt;Primitive Man - Insurmountable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From practitioners of the most brutal form of Death/Sludge arguably
pioneered by them, the latest offering from Primitive Man bludgeons
the anxieties and dread that came with the pandemic into a
slow-burning, gloomy and angry 4 track record. Their sound appears to
have been perfected over the years into the combination of oppressive
mammoth-like riffs, a loud menacing bass, copious amounts of guitar
feedback and noise samples embedded into the background, and drums
with the hint of a twang on the snare leaving the listener in an
atmosphere dripping with tension and apprehension. McCarthy’s vocals
are as wild as ever — there’s undertones of the sludge scream, the
black metal snarl, alloyed with the Death-growl into guttural lows and
highs. This album also includes a cover of “Quiet” by the Smashing
Pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://primitivemandoom.bandcamp.com/album/insurmountable&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan McCarthy’s other project — Vermin Womb — also saw a new release
that I’d also recommend. It’s similar sounding in the instrumentation
and overall feel but has songs with a more blackened and chaotic
Grindcore style.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://verminwomb.bandcamp.com/album/retaliation&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;drowse-wane-into-it&#34;&gt;Drowse - Wane into It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know no better words to describe this than lucid dream-like.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://drowse.bandcamp.com/album/wane-into-it&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3404655629/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kathryn-mohr-holly&#34;&gt;Kathryn Mohr - Holly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liminal perhaps describes the kind of music Kathryn Mohr makes
accurately and in a single word but it’s got a lot more to it. I find
that listening to this album when I need to unwind makes the process a
lot easier and a great deal more enjoyable, but I’m inevitably left
craving more. Holly has droney chords strummed on a Jazzmaster (?),
fuzzy and exclusively on neck pickups — and I feel like I shouldn’t
have to describe this any further but I’ll just add that it takes the
edge off the typical bright tone. This perfectly compliments haunting,
layered vocals that sometimes sound off-key. The vocals don’t appear
to be too central to her sound and songs are often instrumental,
overlaid with pretty synth riffs and crucially set in a brown-noise
base. Also worth noting is the way tracks are arranged in the style of
a cassette release — both sides have short instrumental introductory
pieces and is available as a cassette on her Bandcamp!&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kathrynmohr.bandcamp.com/album/holly&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 0; width: 400px; height: 42px;&#34;
    src=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=201745917/size=small/tracklist=false/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/&#34; seamless&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chat-pile-god-s-country&#34;&gt;Chat Pile - God&amp;rsquo;s Country&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What hasn’t been said about the Purple man that took the world by
storm with their debut album, under the Flenser label, no less. Heavy
guitars and skull numbing reverb laden drums thumping out slow and
dark songs about despair and the anti-anthem “Why”. Needless to say,
I’m sold on the Purple Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscreance-convergence&#34;&gt;Miscreance - Convergence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across them when the Dead Neanderthals tweeted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Not enough people are talking about this album. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A perfect mix of Death (Human era), Pestilence (Consvming era) and Revenant!&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ&#34;&gt;https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dead Neanderthals (also on bsky.app) (@deadneanderthal) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/deadneanderthal/status/1620492647025758210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 31, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and I’m in full agreement. Being the dedicated Death fan (for life),
this does indeed sound like Chuck Schuldiner performed the
vocals. Both Pestilence and Death drips off their thrashy, bass-heavy
minor key riffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mamaleek-diner-coffee&#34;&gt;Mamaleek - Diner Coffee (?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Flenser repeatedly tweets, Who is Mamaleek?. Weird noisey and
dark but it’s really hard to describe them without sounding insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meshuggah-immutable&#34;&gt;Meshuggah - Immutable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to realise they had a new release out when I saw and absurd
“meme” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX4GOltUDdA&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube. It’s got the usual sick groove but I could
have sworn a pronounced blackening to their riffs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wormrot-hiss&#34;&gt;Wormrot - Hiss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s got everything a Wormrot album promises in grindcore, but this
release felt more mellow as compared to the brutally fast and precise
riffing/drums from earlier releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exhumed-to-the-dead&#34;&gt;Exhumed - To The Dead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morbidly groovy and detuned Death/Grind, often reminiscent of
Carcass’s very old grindcore delivers human entrails yet again. 2022
has been a prolonged fangirling moment for Doktor Ross Sewage and
every band he’s played with. His twitter feed is never boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;russian-circles-gnosis&#34;&gt;Russian Circles - Gnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-metal but it often sounds black and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://russiancircles.bandcamp.com/album/gnosis&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wake-thought-form-descent&#34;&gt;Wake - Thought Form Descent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no words I can conjure to describe Wake humanly. It’s got
everything — sickeningly catchy riffs like grindcore, dark ambient
black metal and post-metal — but then there’s so much more. It’s loud
and hits you like a tidal wave but is also meditative of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wakegrind.bandcamp.com/album/thought-form-descent&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hath-all-that-was-promised&#34;&gt;Hath - All That Was Promised&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Death metal that is blackened and sometimes slightly
technical. There are mellow passages too but ultimately the album
feels not as abstract as older Death metal and betrays a sort of
sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mares-of-thrace-the-exile&#34;&gt;Mares of Thrace - The Exile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was easily one of the most tension filled, deathy Doom metal
records of my year.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://maresofthrace.bandcamp.com/album/the-exile&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;heriot-profound-mortality&#34;&gt;Heriot - Profound Mortality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to pin down but it’s black, hardcore and deranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hexis-aeturnum&#34;&gt;Hexis - Aeturnum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unabashedly Satanic, these black metallers deliver the loudest and
fullest sounding black metal record I’ve heard in a while. The air is
heavy and icy but the vocals hit like a draft from a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scarcity-aveilut&#34;&gt;Scarcity - Aveilut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bleak, just the way post-black metal should be. This was an early
contender for the list.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://scarcity-nyc.bandcamp.com/album/aveilut&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thou-and-mizmor-myopia&#34;&gt;Thou &amp;amp; Mizmor - Myopia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trepidation and tension does make one myopic. Doom with a good deal of
sludge mixed in, this is bleak and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
Find them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/myopia&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughtcrimes-altered-pasts&#34;&gt;thoughtcrimes - Altered Pasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaotic but with some vague semblance to the newer Alice in Chains -
post Robert DuVall’s joining. Thoroughly noise like the label
indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog revamp and starting to understand Hugo better</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/02/blog-revamp-and-starting-to-understand-hugo-better.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2023/02/blog-revamp-and-starting-to-understand-hugo-better.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d decided to make the switch to a blogging workflow that I could use
with Emacs back in December and &lt;a href=&#34;../blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; setting it up from
scratch. Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet acquainted with writing original layout
templates, style-sheets or with organising content into sections in as
simple and sane a manner as I wanted to, I&amp;rsquo;d settled for outsourcing
most of this to a fairly &lt;a href=&#34;https:/github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch&#34;&gt;basic theme&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, I grew dissatisfied
with how the site looked and how it organised my content and so I
spent some time customising the theme, which took a while to figure
out. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with it still. I then tried changing themes a few
times but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that really worked for me. That I
didn&amp;rsquo;t want any JavaScript I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand, or could understand
for that matter, effectively eliminated a lot of the options I had
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then dawned on me that I could maybe attempt writing a theme for
myself from (nearly) scratch when I found two themes that seemed to
check out most of my requirements. The first of these was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mavidser/hugo-rocinante/&#34;&gt;rocinante&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mavidser&#34;&gt;Sid Verma&lt;/a&gt;, a great and adequately minimal theme with added support for
photo albums as posts. My only qualms with it were the somewhat messy
style sheets and cryptic templates that made personalising a bit of an
ordeal. The second, however, was simply genius and it took me close to
no time to figure it out, despite thinking it to be too advanced for
me — there was no theme sub-module and everything was in the home
directory it was from somebody&amp;rsquo;s personal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it was Drew DeVault&amp;rsquo;s and I&amp;rsquo;d seen it as something of
an inspiration from the start. A quick glance at &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com&#34;&gt;Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;
should convey what I mean by minimal and functional. I jumped right
into a local clone of his &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/drewdevault.com&#34;&gt;sourcehut repo&lt;/a&gt; and got down to making it my
own. I added some minor spice to the `single.html` layout under `blog`
and made an additional few for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posts from my Wordpress blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t want listed on the homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a section index that listed the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fiction (just the one post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;About me&lt;/em&gt; page (not a section, unlike before)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the browser friendly copy of my &lt;a href=&#34;../emacs/literate_emacs_configuration.html&#34;&gt;Literate Emacs Configuration&lt;/a&gt; with
a table of contents in the sidebar and heading anchors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t want unnecessary taxonomy pages like before or
like those from the rocinante theme and that all my regular blog
posts, Emacs configuration and fiction on the homepage. The prospect
of having to write descriptions for each of these — had I maintained
separate sections for each like before — was daunting, to say the
least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also loved the idea of displaying &amp;ldquo;featured posts&amp;rdquo; from the blogs I
follow through Drew&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring&#34;&gt;openring&lt;/a&gt;, written in Go. The only issue I
encountered was with adding this to the Github actions workflows since
it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as the one Sourcehut uses and the absurdly
large number of modules is mind-boggling. Until I find a way of
getting this automated, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep at running the command
manually every few days before committing/pushing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openring &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -s https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -s https://sourcehut.org/blog/index.xml &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -s https://ambikamath.com/feed/ &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &amp;lt; webring-in.template &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &amp;gt; layouts/partials/webring-out.html
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also some issues with date handling in the ox-hugo setup
and I ended up rewriting the org-capture template to allow for entries
into both the main blog section and the miscellaneous one. The capture
template now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs-lisp&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;with-eval-after-load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;org-capture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;org-hugo-new-post-capture&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Returns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;`org-capture&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; template string for new Hugo post.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;`org-capture-templates&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; for more information.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

discussing a bunch of tangential points like design choices and the
&amp;ldquo;criteria&amp;rdquo; for making this the best starting point for my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll
perhaps cover those in later articles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Death metal</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/finding-death-metal.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/finding-death-metal.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been into a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of metal for the last 10-odd years of my life and
has had a way of making some of the most mundane or depressive phases
bearable, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes even uplifting. But that&amp;rsquo;s perhaps a shallow
take on metal given what it means for me. The process of &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; for
an album or artist to listen to is one of the most surreal experiences
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to revisit nearly every day. There&amp;rsquo;s my
(inevitably) long list of favourites to pick from, and with me often
forgetting names of bands or albums, &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; when I decide to listen
to them, it gets even more interesting to dredge though my library on
Spotify and immensely gratifying to listen to them after I&amp;rsquo;ve found
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about just &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; metal. Death metal is something
that&amp;rsquo;s fascinated me since I exited my &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt;- and &lt;em&gt;nu&lt;/em&gt;-metal-
phases. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bands like Metallica, Judas Priest, or System
of a Down, which I was really big into until then, had lost their
charm for me, but with this ever increasing need for titillation (I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know it to be &amp;ldquo;stimulation&amp;rdquo; in the ADHD sense then), I found
that I was looking for more intense and fuller sounding music. I liked
the concept and premise of it from what I&amp;rsquo;d read (on Wikipedia, no
less), although I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like harsh vocals. This is from
around 2011 and since back then I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just browse youtube, I had
to read about bands, find those that &lt;em&gt;sounded&lt;/em&gt; interesting, and then get
their music from somewhere. It was then that I forayed into my first
&lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt;-metal music ever. The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy (which a
friend had introduced me to earlier), and Enslaved which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; agreed
with me, and some Deicide, Decapitated which I had mixed
feelings. &lt;em&gt;Deathcrush&lt;/em&gt; by Mayhem was another which I&amp;rsquo;d desperately
wanted to like but have expectedly grown to hate over the
years. Soilwork, Meshuggah and a few others came by and those
stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to really get into the &amp;ldquo;classics&amp;rdquo; of Death metal
because soon after this, I somehow just stopped looking for new music
to listen to regularly a while and lapsed into a lazy selection of
popular prog-metal and a lot of the worst music I&amp;rsquo;ve ever listened to
(you know, metalcore/deathcore which I think of as junk now). Whatever
little Death metal I&amp;rsquo;d heard haunted me though. It was like this
faint, nearly inaudible voice at the back of my head that kept telling
me to get back to Death metal and that I would be able to find
something that I really liked. Till date, the &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo; has only ever
gotten louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; people I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to about this fascination only tell
me that it&amp;rsquo;s sounded forced and describe it as if it were
self-inflicted torture or something that I&amp;rsquo;ve only gotten accustomed
to. That&amp;rsquo;s always left me reluctant to talk about it or even
contemplate what was happening then. Thinking about it today, while
trying to find something &amp;ldquo;appropriate&amp;rdquo; to listen to for the moment,
I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of that feeling of oppressive discomfort I&amp;rsquo;d experience
when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to &amp;ldquo;explain&amp;rdquo; my relationship with this kind of
music to somebody, especially when I was starkly aware of the fact
that they weren&amp;rsquo;t even into metal. Worse, when they had opinions like
&amp;ldquo;all metalheads are shit people&amp;rdquo; and sundry variations of &amp;ldquo;the music I
listen to is better than yours&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Metal is attention seeking&amp;rdquo; takes
the cake though, considering it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes true, unironically. And
there&amp;rsquo;s some truth to &amp;ldquo;all metalheads are shit people&amp;rdquo; as I&amp;rsquo;ve come to
realise. I didn&amp;rsquo;t dislike Death metal, nor was I forcing myself
through something unpleasant. I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to listen to it because I
instinctively knew it was what I really liked. Anyway I got back to it
about a year ago when I met JP on twitter and we started loosely
exchanging recommendations and subsequently interactions with other
musicians too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-death-metal-aesthetic&#34;&gt;the Death metal aesthetic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to try and understand what it was that I went through that made
this particular brand of metal hold so powerful an influence over me,
I think I must try and explore what goes on in my thoughts when I
listen to it. It&amp;rsquo;s, of course, obvious that people look to music to
vastly different ends. This is also based on something MR had
referenced in a response to an earlier draft. I later realised that
this was part of what I&amp;rsquo;d intended to write about, but had somehow
overlooked it before prematurely publishing this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labelling any kind of extreme metal as &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; or as any other synonym
of it is superficial and meaningless because metal has am, often,
twisted &lt;em&gt;aesthetic&lt;/em&gt;. Keep in mind that &amp;ldquo;aesthetic&amp;rdquo; here is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; used in
the (often erroneous and colloquial) sense of the word implying &lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt;
but more about what it evokes in the mind in terms of what one
associates with it, much like TM Krishna&amp;rsquo;s description of it&amp;rsquo;s meaning
in &lt;em&gt;A Southern Music&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHECK THIS REFERENCE and DEFINITION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started off with bands like Metallica, Judas Priest and others,
it felt &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the songs I listened to to be exciting and
uplifting but also not with outright toasty 190 bpm riffs and harsh
vocals. They had to sound &amp;ldquo;melodic&amp;rdquo;, in the conventional sense that
Indian music often adheres to, where there&amp;rsquo;s clean vocals singing a
tune. I also found that I often couldn&amp;rsquo;t listen to full albums through
even if I wanted to. There were a handful of songs that I&amp;rsquo;d play over
and over, and perhaps some other softer music to go back to. I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t label bands like Led Zeppelin &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; metal but back even
these were quite a good distance away from what most of my friends
listened to. It makes sense that some of the first extreme metal bands
I&amp;rsquo;d liked had some parts that were &amp;ldquo;conventionally&amp;rdquo; pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why scream and rend one&amp;rsquo;s throat &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIND THAT ARCHAIC WORD I WAS LOOKING
FOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just to make it sound uglier? Why write riffs that are so
unpleasant to the ear and make no &amp;ldquo;sense&amp;rdquo; harmonically? Let me start
by saying those constraints were limiting from the start and there is
an aesthetic to these too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-dot-groove&#34;&gt;1. Groove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aesthetic that&amp;rsquo;s the most commonly relatable: &lt;em&gt;groove&lt;/em&gt;. Do you
find your body slowly moving to the rhythm of a riff? Guitars by
themselves needn&amp;rsquo;t have this. Put a loud, sometimes distorted bass
playing the same riff on a lower octave. Add a double kick drumkit,
with not just the clean filtered drums you hear elsewhere. The pedal
trigger sounds are included in a truly acoustic recording and you&amp;rsquo;ll
slowly start finding yourself moved by the rapid double bass beat and
perhaps even tilting your head forward ever so slightly each time the
snare is hit. This isn&amp;rsquo;t as apparent all the time considering a lot of
Death metal isn&amp;rsquo;t like conventional songs with a repetitive
verse-chorus pattern and a lot of riffs tend to be rhythmically
complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-dot-wholeness-of-sound&#34;&gt;2. Wholeness of sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone that needs a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of stimulation, it has a &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; sound and
that is something a lot of other music I listen to doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to
have. I often describe the music that Strapping Young Lad makes as
&amp;ldquo;insane vocals&amp;rdquo; on top of a &amp;ldquo;wall of sound&amp;rdquo; (the latter phrase was
stolen). The guitars and the other instruments are relatively very
loud and Devin Townsend layers synthesizers and other sounds on top of
this making the final sound a complex amalgam that hits all the right
parts of the ear. Of course, Strapping Young Lad isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
Death metal, except perhaps their self-titled album. A lot of modern
Death metal has a similar approach, often without synths and other
instruments. Vocals are loud too but this approach diminishes reliance
on exclusively vocals for setting the theme. It&amp;rsquo;s as if all
instruments are involved in developing the final sound, and yes, this
includes the bass guitar too. This, for me, means I get music that
tickles all those brain cells simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-dot-mood-based-listening&#34;&gt;3. Mood-based listening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really liked to label bands or albums because most genre
tags can be reductive and restrictive. To me, Death metal encompasses
not just conventionally recognised bands such as Deicide, Obituary and
Death, but others that have a certain sound blended into their own
styles. I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned &lt;em&gt;SYL&lt;/em&gt; by Strapping Young Lad earlier and that to
me has elements of this sound. What is this sound? It&amp;rsquo;s one or more
guitars playing a brand of aggressive, typically complex riffs with a
lot of &lt;em&gt;chug&lt;/em&gt; and tremolo-picked phrases thrown in. The guitars aren&amp;rsquo;t
slurred into the ambience like in Black metal but clear enough that it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too much effort to try and figure them out. Additionally,
there&amp;rsquo;s usually equally aggressive, double kick drums with the
occasional blast beat with the entire sound of the kicks (including
the triggers) heard distinctly; and the bass &lt;strong&gt;audibly&lt;/strong&gt; thumping out a
similar riff as what is played on the guitars, on the lower octave of
course. It isn&amp;rsquo;t so much about the speed as much as the aggressiveness
to the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even within Death metal, there&amp;rsquo;s a wide variety of bands to choose
from, each with a fairly unique sound of their own, but more
importantly collections vastly different emotions that each of them
evoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two guitarists on the front-facing corners of a stage with a
drummer somewhere in the middle and a bassist slightly off-centre
stage. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need to be long hair or inverted crosses or
satanic symbols anywhere. The backdrop could be unintelligible text
like the Chat Pile logo here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../images/chat_pile.jpg&#34;&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/TFUmClD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My music tastes are supremely &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; and that I&amp;rsquo;m unabashedly
selfish about it. I can talk about it, discussing the physical
experiences and associations I have with the sound on platforms
like twitter or Mastodon, but never in-person, except with a short
list of people I know appreciate discussions about this, at varying
depths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The music I listen to at any given point of time is solely
dependant on how or what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling at that point of time and that
it can change without warning. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t only listen to Death
metal, I could sound entirely disinterested in it occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t end here. Even within Death metal, I often have to
spend some time to identify what band or album to listen to because I
form deep-rooted associations with the sound of each album or
band. Only some bands sound right for me. Before I started writing
this article, I went though some 20-odd artists looking for one artist
that was known to make longer and more intricate Death metal songs
despite being one of the first wave. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found it yet (and
anyone that reads this, if you know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, do hit me
up on Mastodon). But then I settled into &lt;em&gt;Descend into Depravity&lt;/em&gt; by
Morbid Angel and &lt;em&gt;Pierced from Within&lt;/em&gt; by Suffocation and they&amp;rsquo;ve worked
great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s when I don&amp;rsquo;t find the right Death metal, and I&amp;rsquo;m incessantly
shuffling though Spotify&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fans also like&amp;rdquo; or the abomination this is
their landing screen, on my phone, that I feel like that discomfort
returns. This must be a neurodivergent thing because no-one else I&amp;rsquo;ve
met has ever shared anything even remotely similar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Having to use Windows, reluctantly</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/having-to-use-windows-reluctantly.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/having-to-use-windows-reluctantly.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my laptop is an ancient clay tablet that can barely run Emacs
and a couple of other things without everything crashing, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to
use a lab workstation with about 128 GB RAM and a fairly new Intel
processor for running some of my analyses. It&amp;rsquo;s phenomenally fast for
a computer that runs Windows and gets most things done easily. It&amp;rsquo;s
only when I run something that&amp;rsquo;s something memory intensive when
things really start to get muddled up. I could just be incredibly bad
at R programming but boy, it hit 105 GB of the RAM and slowed the hell
down. It&amp;rsquo;s been like this since last night and now there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I
can do but wait. Surely a Linux or FreeBSD system would have had lower
core functioning thresholds for all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fairly weird detail was that it was set to use a UK keyboard
layout unlike almost any PC that&amp;rsquo;s made in these parts. It was so easy
to change but almost no-one had it figured until I got here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugo, Org and starting over at a new blog</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d decided to give up on my free WordPress blog a while back, after
having watched a SystemCrafters &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/AfkrzFodoNw&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on how to blog from Emacs (&lt;em&gt;d&amp;rsquo;oh&lt;/em&gt;,
I just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do everything from Emacs). Of course, daviwil only
covered the basics of writing and exporting using Emacs&amp;rsquo; built-in
packages and later for deploying it on GitHub / Sourcehut pages. And
it took me a good year to get down to making the switch but apparently
moving to a new place for work is the motivation it required. It felt
like cheating to use Jekyll on GitHub and I wanted something that
could be deployed to a Sourcehut site easily too (Sourcehut blocks any
CDN-based CSS loaded into the site&amp;rsquo;s HTML) and I wanted something
extremely minimal, like Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; but with even fewer
frills — no images anywhere except for if a blog post required
them. Looking at his blog source, however, made me realise that there
was a lot more to that minimalism than one could see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-setup&#34;&gt;Basic setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has come through fairly well, so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve got an &lt;a href=&#34;../emacs/emacs-literate-configuration/#ox-hugo-since-the-go-org-keep-wrecking-up-links&#34;&gt;org-capture
setup&lt;/a&gt; for this that links up every new entry captured into a master
posts file, adding all the relevant info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exporting to markdown (Org just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good enough support
yet), tags and organisation of pages into bundles is handled by
ox-hugo &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The
header arguments in the capture template cover everything. With
Emacs&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;.dir-locals.el&lt;/code&gt; feature, a file of that name in the home
directory of the blog ensures every new entry or modification into the
master posts file gets auto-exported to markdown on save. The contents
are quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs-lisp&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Emacs&amp;rsquo;s Org mode, this posts file has subheadings under a
&lt;em&gt;Posts&lt;/em&gt; header, each of which is a blog post and is exported to a
sub-directory under &lt;code&gt;~/content/posts/&lt;/code&gt; as a lone &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; keeping with
the page-bundle kind of organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where every sub-directory in the top-level directory has a page of its
own while the home-page is the sole &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; in the same. What I&amp;rsquo;ve
got going feels a little hacky but I&amp;rsquo;ll figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;automatic-deployment&#34;&gt;Automatic deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo, being a static site generator, creates HTML exports into
&lt;code&gt;~/public&lt;/code&gt; and this is what the site uses. All major git hosting
services have configurable CI/CD for deploying these to the domain and
they&amp;rsquo;re run automatically if you have a specific file in either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the root directory of the repo for Sourcehut called &lt;code&gt;.build.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.github/workflows/&lt;/code&gt; for GitHub called anything you want with a
&lt;code&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine uses &lt;code&gt;github-pages&lt;/code&gt; and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot to fix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heading anchors on top-level pages are superfluous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe consider switching to a theme-agnostic setup like Drew&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get rid of unnecessary indentation like in the table of contents and headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add anchors even to lower level headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch to a Sourcehut site (eventually and when I can afford it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is but a blog post written, and edited, within half an hour so I
likely haven&amp;rsquo;t covered a lot of important things. I&amp;rsquo;ll add some links

come across them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pets, put in context</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2017/06/pets-put-in-context.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2017/06/pets-put-in-context.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pets and feral animals have been shown to cause great amounts of
destruction to native wildlife, but since very little research has
been done in that field, things remain unclear. Most of the cases
where the extreme case of extinction occurred were on islands, but
this does not indicate that the mainland is safe from this. A lack of
visible evidence, either scientific or not, &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; indicate
that such animals are not killing wildlife regularly, or that the
consequences of having them around are negligible. There are several
signs that some areas may be more vulnerable to the effects of
invasive animals than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that haven&amp;rsquo;t read my &lt;a href=&#34;../blog/2016/01/a-dark-side-to-pets/&#34;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt; on the issues
with keeping free ranging pets and having stray carnivores, I would
recommend going through it first although it is not an absolute
necessity to understand the concepts explained here. Also, some
evolutionary concepts are dealt with so for a better understand
consider going through my articles on evolution as well. Note that
this is a clarification to those who are not convinced of the issues
brought to light in the older article. I will also explain the issues
associated with the introduction of non-carnivorous pets in a
&lt;em&gt;previously undisturbed&lt;/em&gt; environment. The driving factor behind
my writing this article was conversations with people not familiar
with the scientific way of thought that made me realise that unless
the complete issues are spelled out, the ideas will not be
understood. Additionally, another snake was nearly killed recently by
an adopted feral cat (refer to my older article for the details of the
snake killed). It must also be noted here that pets not only include
cats and dogs but also livestock such a cows, goats, sheep and
buffaloes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of the introduction of animals into an area
previously unexposed to it can be very subtle for the lay mind to
comprehend since the interactions between humans and the environment
are virtually ignored. Inter-connectedness is the quintessence of
ecology without which none of its theories can be justified. Similar
are the consequences of introducing alien plant species (alien here
refers to those species from often from other continents, but not
necessarily always so) or with disease. &lt;em&gt;Lantana camara&lt;/em&gt; was
introduced in India a couple of hundred years earlier and today it has
replaced the understory in most of the peninsular dry deciduous
forests and occupied a great portion of the arid scrub jungles. It,
however, cannot be easily removed (as is with the case of free ranging
pets and strays) as now several other animals and plants have
developed certain crucial interactions with &lt;em&gt;Lantana&lt;/em&gt;. Removal
of &lt;em&gt;Lantana&lt;/em&gt; has been largely unsuccessful for various reasons,
which is atleast in this case advantageous but it may not be the case
always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wish to make clear through the course of this essay is that
human intervention in the functioning of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s environment can
no longer be ignored since human presence has grown disproportionately
in the last few thousand years. This means that the repercussions of
even growing food for even a tenth of the current population are so
great that it could drive several species of native wildlife extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isolation-in-its-various-forms&#34;&gt;Isolation in its various forms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What in essence happens when a ecosystem, previously unexposed to a
certain kind of animal or plant, is suddenly introduced with an alien
species? Tribal communities living in isolation were exposed to
disease such as common cold and other such diseases by visiting people
from modern society which spread rapidly (examples of which are seen
in the Jarawas and explained in Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs and
Steel&lt;/em&gt;). But note that this is a closed environment. Such tribals
typically live outside cities with limited interaction to the outside
world. The consequences of the introduction of an alien species is
typically the same in several cases. Unprepared and susceptible, at
the mercy of the new species, most are affected, usually
adversely. This must is to be kept in mind albeit it should also be
adverted to the fact that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In talking about carnivorous pets in my last article, I got too
carried away by them and failed to touch on the consequences of
herbivorous “pets” on undisturbed ecosystems, as was pointed out in
one of the comments. What should one expect with free ranging
herbivores such as cows and other livestock in such a scenario?
Numbers of individuals introduced here are insignificant since the
“lethal dose” of number of these animals will in any case be attained
over a short period of time. Herds of goats and cows feed over large
tracts of grass covered areas which is usually unable to regenerate
due to their continuous onslaught. The effects are naturally amplified
(given the additional absence of carnivores) in the case of smaller
herbivores such as rabbits and hares which breed rapidly and clear
large stretches of grassland. Uncontrolled grazing results in the
denudation of natural forest in its various forms and hence native
herbivores are the first hit. Since the native fauna and flora
maintained an equilibrium between plant consumption and animal
population, this is now disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when do the effects of introduced species get felt? I have already
suggested that extinctions due to introduced species has a high
prevalence in the case of islands. What about islands is so peculiar?
I will return to these questions a little later in the essay. A stable
ecosystem is one where the population of each species is regulated or
maintained in spite of predation, herbivory and other such
interactions. That is to say that if a certain number of (for example)
a bird species are killed each year, that species continues to survive
because over time new individuals replace those lost. The predators
continually switch over to alternate food sources and hence the
pressure on the prey reduces (from the constant high pressure offered
by specialist predators, which are typically rare in the wild). This
is usually seen if the ecosystem is spread over a large area with a
sufficiently large population of prey that is distributed through the
area, allowing movement of populations across the area. If the
predator species kill too many individuals of that bird species, the
predators will have nothing to feed on and hence will die out with the
bird population, but this extreme is quite rare. This is usually
avoided and such an equilibrium is in all cases maintained by varying
numbers of predator and prey. The same is the case with plant species
and herbivores. Such plasticity exists in all ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islands are continually changing in their species composition. Rather
than having an equilibrium between populations of species, there is a
balance between extinctions (or to be more precise extirpations) and
immigrations. A limited availability of resources allows only a small
number of individuals to reside on it (excesses are not trimmed off
and eventually drive the species extinct). The number of species also
is considerably lower than on the corresponding mainland. Combined,
the two mentioned factors allow a very low number of species,
represented by a very small population inhabiting the island. Hence,
local extinctions are frequent and seemingly causeless, although minor
changes of any aspect are the cause. The same is the case with
fragmented forests and “islands” on the mainland. Once extinction
occurs, there is a greater likelihood of “immigrating” species to
establish themselves. This fragile state of island biodiversity
prevents the continuity of life once an invasive species is introduced
since minor changes can disrupt the species composition. In addition,
islands are more likely to have species that although might have
evolved from those of the mainland, are considerably different and
hence endemic. The extirpation (or extinction) of a species implies
that the species that comes in its place could be altogether
different, hence endemics and in most cases even other species lost on
an island are lost forever. Island fauna is also tame since exposures
to predators are typically lacking due to the absence of such a
selection pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation also can be created by the construction of man-made
barriers, especially in the case of plants and herpetofauna and other
fauna with limited mobility. Roads, canals and other such structures
limits further their mobility. Other more subtle selective pressures
applied could also play a role in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some form of isolation that is seen in cases where species have been
introduced, plays an important role. Islands are isolated since they
are less easily accessible to reptiles, amphibians and most plants
from almost anywhere else. Plants, as already suggested cannot bear
the brunt of the advance of herbivores unlike animals which tend to,
over time, develop behavioural adaptations. There are however more
complex forms of isolation, even on the mainland, explained below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequences-of-invasion&#34;&gt;Consequences of invasion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Island fauna, as mentioned above, is tame and hence introduced
predators (such as cats and dogs) can approach them without having to
expend energy in stalking and other forms of subtlety. In the case of
flora, islands are as susceptible to denudation as the mainland as
plants (unlike animals) are not as dynamic and cannot survive the
onslaught of a rapidly growing population of herbivores. Forest
fragmentation ensues in part due to overgrazing by livestock and the
removal of forest cover to meet food requirements with agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of forest fragmentation, an original population of a
species specific to that forest type, becomes isolated in these
pockets. In most cases, likely including that of birds, the
individuals from each region cannot or do not migrate to others due to
territorial boundaries. The consequence is small unstable populations
of species that are extremely susceptible to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extirpate&#34;&gt;extirpation&lt;/a&gt; for a variety
of reasons. Inbreeding causes loss of genetic diversity and
consequently deleterious mutations accumulate causing lower likelihood
of survival; loss of genetic variation also increases the risk of
extirpation by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zoonosis&#34;&gt;zoonotic&lt;/a&gt; disease, which has been shown to have a
greater prevalence in the fauna inhabiting fragmented forests even
otherwise, such as in the case of Lion-tailed Macaques (&lt;em&gt;Macaca
silenus&lt;/em&gt;) and Civets in the Western Ghats (and additionally other
mammal species); and predation itself can very likely wipe out the
small population, the risks of which are greatly increased by
introduced (typically animal) species which are either better adapted
to hunting, or through competition for limited food resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cows and other livestock are generally kept in large groups such that
the yield of milk will be sufficient to not only satisfy individual
and family needs but for its use as a commercialized source of
livelihood. The cattle has to be provided not just dry feed but need
fresh fodder for which a good source is grass in scrub jungles and
meadows, and several shrubs in the same and other types of
forest. These are readily used. As sensible as this may sound, large
numbers of cattle are detrimental to the forest ecosystem. Selective
feeding on plants, that is subsidised from predation by human
intervention can result in the formation of an imbalanced ecosystem:
native herbivores lose out on vital food resources and hence drop in
numbers as a result of which predators are affected. This leads to a
more permanent loss of forest cover in part since less faeces in the
soil implies less fertility and hence native plant species don&amp;rsquo;t
survive and disperse. The paucity of plants adversely affects bees,
other pollinators on which birds and some animals feed, and affects
native herbivore populations which again impacts the predators. This
cycle repeats itself several times to leave either small fragments of
forest or none at all and as a result not one but several species of
biota is impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease of animals, known as zoonotic disease, are on the rise as a
result of close interaction of wildlife and humans. Diseases of urban
and man-made origin are now prevalent in several feral and domestic
animals. With the high incidence of these animals entering native
forests, these diseases very likely will be transmitted to wildlife
and being unequipped to deal with such, a large number of individuals
will be lost. Additionally, forest fragmentation by human activities
reduces wildlife to even smaller groups of individuals that face a
greater likelihood of contracting zoonotic diseases from nearby human
settlements. Smaller populations that have limited interaction with
each other are more susceptible to disease. Diseases of livestock such
as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest&#34;&gt;rinderpest&lt;/a&gt; are known to affect not only wild bovine species but
reportedly affect cervines (i.e. Deer) and other related wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Species, selectively impacted by disease or predation, can cause
additionally complications. Disease of carnivores resulting in their
extermination causes a boom in herbivore populations which as a result
of overgrazing leads to loss of habitat. A cascade of extinctions are
likely to follow: this loss of food sources for herbivores can be
detrimental to other herbivores which would have to resort to
migration to survive and would otherwise perish. Any predatorial
species dependent on these animals would also suffer. A similar result
can occur by the loss of herbivores to disease or predation: with less
fertile faeces, lowered fertility reduces the dispersal of trees or
selectively propagates certain species which may or may not be
beneficial to the ecosystem; the predators due to a lack of prey die
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible ways feral animals can be controlled are few: culling and
sterilisation are possibly the most effective and easily implemented,
although these are quite inhumane. Rescue agencies in cities catch and
tend to such animals and usually give the animals out as pets
later. This could be a more sensible and humane method although
excesses have to be dealt with rapidly. Sterilization might be in the
longer run more effective. Keeping domestic and adopted cats indoors
at all times is the possibly the only way their killing of wildlife
can be prevented. Dealing with cattle in India is further complicated
by the fact that cows are considered sacred. I shall not advocate any
measure to deal with cattle for this reason (although probably I will
write about this issue later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now is apparent that these issues have to be better studied and
areas that face greater risks have to be identified. Measures taken
will have to be specific to those areas and have to be implemented
rapidly without fail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Misunderstanding evolution</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2017/02/misunderstanding-evolution.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2017/02/misunderstanding-evolution.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who does really understand evolution? (Wait, is it even true?!) Even
if it is, who really has the better idea? What the hell did Darwin
really do on the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt;? Well, I have some answers. In this
two-part essay, I will be discussing how to understand evolution as a
concept and will be touching upon the babble behind the scenes. This
part is a general background to the concept of evolution, dealing with
the &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; behind it rather than the concepts themselves. The second
part will deal with the theories of evolution and their finer
aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, I found that a lot of the concepts that I
thought I understood were actually more complicated. Obviously, I had
to wait till the exams to realise this. But then, I figured that if I
could understand what went wrong at that time, anyone could, and
additionally prepare in such a way that they really understand the
concept as a whole, in all its finer aspects. What hampers such
precise understanding of facts is assumptions and
expectations. Spiritual predispositions and other such forces tend to
cloud judgement and, hence, come in the way of logical thought. The
other most significant antagonist of scientific thought is (and I
don&amp;rsquo;t mean the kind of thought that religious people lack!) the
undoubting faith in whatever is told. The inability to question and be
skeptical. Now, this might sound weird. It certainly did feel weird
when I realised this. But I believe that by the end of this essay, it
will be well established that skepticism is the key element to
understanding anything. Please note, I intend no animosity towards
spirituality and any comments made in this essay are purely
light-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-the-stage&#34;&gt;Setting the stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most readers would have come across textbooks that describe evolution
with the usual theories and examples. There is Lamarck&amp;rsquo;s theory, which
in most opinions, is outdated and eclipsed by the more robust and
logical Darwinian ideas. Then come the modern theories of Morgan and
others who using Mendel&amp;rsquo;s [then] recently rediscovered ideas, further
complicated things. Well, brush all those aside! Throw them out of
your head! Science is also about starting afresh once things get
muddled up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-talking-about&#34;&gt;What are we talking about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misconceptions that are associated with evolution are what the
mind has to consciously rid itself off. Why these are present in the
first place is another topic altogether which I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I can&amp;rsquo;t talk
about (since it just isn&amp;rsquo;t my cup of tea, yet!) and involves
understanding the functioning of the mind. Suffice it to say that the
mind tends to simplify facts and hence colour the explanation that one
receives when trying to understand a concept. The end result is an
inaccurate understanding of concepts which a good skeptic sees through
when examined finely. These misconceptions I will lay bare here
and it must be noted that only once these are understood will the
concepts I explain make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-dot-time-frames&#34;&gt;1. Time frames&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying processes of evolution have been observed to act over
great expanses of time. The study of fossils (Palaeontology) has had a
very important role to play in the development of evolution as a
concept. Darwin&amp;rsquo;s observations of fossils apart by millions of
years played a crucial role in his understanding of his own
concepts. Fossils are by no means easily found and this highlights the
fact that they are formed in very rare cases. This inherently implies
the period in between formation of two fossils of any kind is
great. In addition to this, their discovery is fraught with
complications that for the purposes of this essay needn&amp;rsquo;t be
elaborated. The end result: fossils found are from times so wide apart
that any changes seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you that have seen the film &lt;em&gt;The Man from Earth&lt;/em&gt;, would have an
idea as to what (spoiler alert!!) someone who lived for fourteen
thousand years would have experienced in a life so long. But the
common man would find it challenging to comprehend even those time
scales involved. Although I could go on about timescales, I&amp;rsquo;d rather
get to the main idea of the talk earlier so I&amp;rsquo;ll share a much-clichéd
analogy to make this concept clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you represent the Earth’s lifetime by a single year, say from
January when it was made to December, the 21st-century would be a
quarter of a second in June – a tiny fraction of the year. But even in
this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very
special: the first when humans can change themselves and their home
planet….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… let’s suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the
cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5
billion-year history of our Earth. What would they have seen? Over
nearly all that immense time, Earth’s appearance would have changed
very gradually.The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major
asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions. Apart from those brief
traumas, nothing happens suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continental landmasses drifted around. Ice cover waxed and
waned. Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became
extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth’s history, the last
one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation
altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of
agriculture.Change has accelerated as human populations rose. Then
other things happened even more abruptly. Within just 50 years —
that’s one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth’s age — the amount
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously
fast…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explanation illustrates the time periods that have shaped
the earth. Human presence graced the earth for so short a period that
what we see in the world today is exceedingly limited. Those are the
timescales that evolution acts over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-dot-generational-factors&#34;&gt;2. Generational factors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very frequently misunderstood aspect of evolution is the strata of
organisms evolution affects. This is closely linked to the first
miscalculation of time frames as you shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common idea the people have is that evolution occurs in the
individual. The &amp;ldquo;learnings&amp;rdquo; of one individual are directly transferred
to their offspring. This is anything but true. Evolution happens over
several generations of individuals. And evolution is more of a
consequence of other changes; individuals of a population don&amp;rsquo;t change
as a result of evolution. Their offspring accumulate changes over
generations that lead to the evolution of a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-dot-evolution-is-not-progress&#34;&gt;3. Evolution is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; progress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there might be evidence of better &lt;em&gt;adaptation&lt;/em&gt; to certain
environmental factors, there is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt; that
occurs as a result of evolution. The whole theory that man is the most
advanced being on this planet isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely true. Evidences of
alternative forms of intelligence exist in other life forms, and
although these may not be on par with &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; as defined by a
human, they certainly are nearly as good in their own way. I won&amp;rsquo;t say
any more about this because this isn&amp;rsquo;t the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make in
any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution is caused by selective survival of individuals
&lt;em&gt;better capable&lt;/em&gt; of surviving in a very specific environment. This only
means that the animal is better capable of surviving in that
environment than say others of its original population. It must be
noted that this I&amp;rsquo;ve only given as a comparison. The two would
interact only if members of the original population still survive, and
if they co-occur or are sympatric (in scientific terms), the added
constraint of limited resources (amongst other factors) would result
in the extermination of the lesser able (that is members of the
original population). The so-called &amp;ldquo;struggle for life&amp;rdquo; is only
metaphorical; animals don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-dot-when-evolution-occurred&#34;&gt;4. When evolution occurred&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution has occurred in the past, is occurring now, and will
continue to occur in the future. This is commonly confounded by the
belief that evolution has occurred and the animals and plants seen
today are the final products of all evolution that has ever
occurred. This gives evolution a &amp;ldquo;creational&amp;rdquo; position, more or less
equal to &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo;. And that is where science differs from God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution occurs continually because there some parts of the
environment that continually change and to &amp;ldquo;keep up&amp;rdquo; with those,
certain individuals of populations are selected out. This also affects
all species on earth. The same species that we see today may not
exist in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-dot-evolution-as-a-fact&#34;&gt;5. Evolution as a fact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think the theories of evolution are fact, that&amp;rsquo;s great! Only
they&amp;rsquo;re not. Like all good theories in science, these can only
something that can be shown to be true in very specific cases, with
&lt;em&gt;some amount of certainty&lt;/em&gt; (yes, the theories have not been proven as a
fact &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t got that already!). As they say in science, a
good theory is one that stands the test of time and
experimentation. Fortunately, for you believers out there,
evolutionary theory has stood the test of time so far. But remember,
that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t give any reason to doubt the theory. The theories of
evolution make clear many of the &amp;ldquo;unexplainable&amp;rdquo; happenings of the
world. I will not be discussing that aspect since I believe that can
be done once you&amp;rsquo;ve understood the concept of evolution itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;darwin-s-influences&#34;&gt;Darwin&amp;rsquo;s influences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting to the theory itself, I feel it would be of good use to
look at the story of Darwin and evolutionary theory. But let me get
one thing clear before I start with even this: the &amp;ldquo;Darwinian&amp;rdquo; theory
of evolution was not Darwin&amp;rsquo;s own. He was too dull-witted to think up
the whole thing himself. What he effectively did was compile
everything at hand and publish it. Even the idea that he should do
this was not his own! It might make more sense, hence, to think of
this as the people or ideas that made him sure enough to write about
it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; Darwin was actually quite imperceptive. His was a very mundane
life and although he had planned on studying medicine, he switched
over to the cloth and learned the scriptures instead and this might
have played an important role in shaping his thought. He had access to
several books in the library and even read some &amp;ldquo;prohibited&amp;rdquo; books
(those books which the clergy thought would endanger their popularity
by getting people interested in science). One such was the &lt;em&gt;Principles
of Geology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are the well-known books that he
carried with him on the voyage of the HMS &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt;: John
Milton&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt; and Charles Lyell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Principles of Geology&lt;/em&gt;. Very
simply, the graphic descriptions of living creatures and the
fascination for them expressed in &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Principles of
Geology&lt;/em&gt; got him thinking about world changing changes that take place
over periods of large amounts of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major influence may have been his grandfather himself. Erasmus
Darwin was a physician and also a poet amongst several other
things. In his poems (&lt;em&gt;The Loves of the Plants&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Temple of
Nature&lt;/em&gt;, it is said that there are mentions of evolution in a similar
capacity to what Darwin spoke of in his &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;. Darwin&amp;rsquo;s own teacher,
Robert Edmond Grant was said to have purported the same theory and had
been considered &amp;ldquo;heretic&amp;rdquo; by Darwin and others of that time. Although
Grant had recieved fame worldwide for his other work, his theory
brought down upon him disdain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So carrying Milton and Lyell, Darwin finally left on the voyage of the
&lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt;, at the crisp age of 22, as an unpaid gentleman&amp;rsquo;s companion
(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but that sounds a lot worse than what it is intended to!)
to the [then] also young Captain Robert FitzRoy. It is suggested that
his predecessor on the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; had committed suicide as a consequence
of &amp;ldquo;loneliness&amp;rdquo;. I am told Darwin got to travel with the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; only
because he had the right shape of the nose. Four years later, they
landed on the Galápagos Islands hoping to find of all things Giant
Tortoises to eat!  What happened next was history. Or rather, what
happened became history only after several years because Darwin was
dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
