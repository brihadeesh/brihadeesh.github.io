    <p>Culture is arguably unique to humans. It possibly arose from the need
to manage larger groups of people that congregated near agricultural
fields as Jared Diamond suggests in Guns, Germs and Steel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> although it may
have originated in tribal or hunter-gatherer societies. It is strongly
linked with religion which can viewed as a cement holding together
larger population masses. Recent developments in its research suggests
two perspectives of culture: an outcome of natural selection which
considers humans part of “nature” and culture as a purely human
construct which arose as a consequence of advanced emotional
intelligence which natural selection (according to believers of this
theory) cannot explain. In order to see the effects on natural
selection, one has to take a neutral stance.</p>
<p>It is established that natural selection cannot be evaded<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and as an
outcome of this culture can be viewed as a consequence of
natural selection. In other words, culture, in the context
of human evolution, was selected for since it subsidised
the struggle for life for the group. Individuals have to
forego some individual “rights” in order to support the
group as a whole. These “rights” include privacy, a certain
amount of aggression towards others in the groups – things
such a revenge – and so on. This is in essence altruistic
which is inherently a group selected trait. The development
of fire, agriculture, medicine and later various
technologies have indeed helped the human race jump forward
in the evolutionary struggle. This is, however, at the
level of the group (group here refers to human society).</p>
<p>One inevitably comes across workers who suggest that culture has
influenced the natural of man and has in a certain sense of the word
excluded humans from natural selection. This is possibly true at the
level of the individual as a cripple would not be able to survive in
the wild as opposed to a healthy individual. Similarly, individuals of
advanced age now have higher life expectancy in contrast to those of
animals or even pre-society humans since parents are taken care of by
offspring. Various other societal precepts have affected how
individuals are selected for today. But since group selection offers a
better means to justify the situation today, it must be viewed in that
perspective.</p>
<p>Now the question arises that evolution produces only advanced species
that are best adapted to survive in the world and that since humans
have the added ability to “think” and “analyse” the consequences of
this “advance” might not be sustainable. This may be true albeit since
evolution is merely the accumulation of adaptions, any form of
foresight (that is required in the intelligent design of humans) in
the adaptations of species that have been brought to existence by
evolutionary mechanisms. Sustainability is merely a human construct
whose proponent is culture. This hence further reinforces the
hypothesis that culture and all of its corollaries are a consequence
of natural selection.</p>
<p>It can thus be concluded that cultural evolution has only affected
individual survival while at the group level, it is but a consequence
of natural selection.</p>
